    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Sometime back we had seen, how to <a href="http://www.rahulpnath.com/blog/configuring-unity-container-comparing-code-and-xml-configuration-side-by-side/">configure the unity container using code/config file</a> and I was using a mix of this in one of my projects. This approach soon became an overhead, as the manual wiring up of registrations is really cumbersome and also error prone. Mostly there were missing registrations only to be found out, when doing test runs or deployments. We soon were forced to move out of the manual registration and find a new way to register dependencies.</p>

<p>The below image by <a href="https://twitter.com/ploeh">Mark Seemann</a> sums it all up on when and how to use a Dependency Injection(DI) container and we were right at the bottom, where the whole purpose of a DI becomes pointless.</p>

<p><a href="http://bit.ly/1zLiq6p" class="center" title="Image By Mark Seemann, from http://bit.ly/1zLiq6p"><img src="http://rahulpnath.com/images/ioc_usefulness.png" class="center" alt="Image By Mark Seemann, from http://bit.ly/1zLiq6p"></a></p>

<h4>Convention Over Configuration</h4>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convention_over_configuration">Convention over configuration</a>, is very popular today and there are already many frameworks that have adopted it e.g. MVC, Web Api. Following the same approach would make life much simpler and registration less painful as dependencies would get auto registered, if the convention is followed. Conventions could vary across projects/teams, so it is up to the team to decide on the conventions that are to be followed and have all the developers follow them religiously.</p>

<p>Currently our registration process picks up all the assemblies from the base path and iterates through all the classes that are under the project/application namespace and gets the interfaces out of them and registers them. For interfaces that have multiple definitions we perform named registration based on the class name or name from an attribute on the class or both.</p>

<p>We are using Unity as the IoC container and it does support <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dn507479(v=pandp.30).aspx">convention based registrations</a> out of the box. You can either use the RegisterTypes method or the RegistrationConvention class to specify the conventions. The parameters in both of these approaches enable you to specify the types to register, the mappings to create, the name to use and lifetime. Since in our registration we wanted to use the named convention only in cases where there where multiple registrations for the same interface and the other interfaces were to be registered without any name this default convention had to be modified. Also we did not want to get tightly bound to the IoC container (just in case we want to swap out the container provider) and hence thought of having the convention logics in a separate class and have them registered to the container of choice.</p>

<p>The <em>GetClassesFromAssemblies</em> function iterates over the assemblies from the base application path(bin folder) to get all the dll&rsquo;s used and gets the classes that belong to the namespaces that we want to register. Alternatively you could also pass a list of assemblies if required to be used for the convention. If you want other namespaces too you can filter those in here.</p>

<pre><code class="csharp">private static IEnumerable&lt;Type&gt; GetClassesFromAssemblies(IEnumerable&lt;Assembly&gt; assemblies = null)
{
    var allClasses = assemblies != null ? AllClasses.FromAssemblies(assemblies) : AllClasses.FromAssembliesInBasePath();
    return
        allClasses.Where(
            n =&gt;
                n.Namespace != null
                &amp;&amp; n.Namespace.StartsWith(ApplicationNamespace, StringComparison.InvariantCultureIgnoreCase));
}                                                                                                        
</code></pre>

<p>For each of the type that is returned from the above method we get the list of interfaces that are defined on the type and needs to be registered against the type. In the sample code, I have added a couple of variations of registrations.</p>

<ul>
<li><em>IFooBar</em>        : Has only one implementation</li>
<li><em>IFoo</em>           : Has multiple implementations and should be resolved using <em>IFooFactory</em></li>
<li><em>IFooCustom</em>     : Has multiple implementations and needs to have a custom name (maybe for some reason you do not want the context information to be part of the class name). This is to be resolved using IFooCustomFactory.</li>
<li><em>IFooGeneric<T></em> : This is a generic implementation and the type can be decided at runtime.</li>
</ul>


<p>The <em>GetInterfacesToBeRegistered</em> function gets the interfaces that are to be registered for a given type. For this convention I want to <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5318685/get-only-direct-interface-instead-of-all">get only the direct interfaces</a> that are on the given type and not all the interfaces. The check below for <em>isGenericType</em> on an interface is for <em>IFooGeneric</em> as for generic interfaces the <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3117090/getinterfaces-returns-generic-interface-type-with-fullname-null">GetInterfaces does not return the full information required</a> and we need to use the <em>GetGenericTypeDefinition</em> method instead.</p>

<pre><code class="csharp">private static IEnumerable&lt;Type&gt; GetInterfacesToBeRegistered(Type type)
{
    var allInterfacesOnType = type.GetInterfaces()
        .Select(i =&gt; i.IsGenericType ? i.GetGenericTypeDefinition() : i).ToList();

    return allInterfacesOnType.Except(allInterfacesOnType.SelectMany(i =&gt; i.GetInterfaces())).ToList();
}
</code></pre>

<p>Once we have the interfaces for the type, we add them to an internal mapping list to register it all into the unity container. The internal mapping is against the interface type definition and has the list of classes that implements the interface.Now that we have all the types and interfaces to be registered, we need to register them into the container. For any interface that has only one type implementing it, we register it with default name else we get the name from the class name or the attribute that decorates the class if any.</p>

<pre><code class="csharp">private static void RegisterConventions(IUnityContainer container)
{
    foreach (var typeMapping in internalTypeMapping)
    {
        if (typeMapping.Value.Count == 1)
        {
            var type = typeMapping.Value.First();
            container.RegisterType(typeMapping.Key, type);
        }
        else
        {
            foreach (var type in typeMapping.Value)
            {
                container.RegisterType(typeMapping.Key, type, GetNameForRegsitration(type));
            }
        }
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>The dependency with UnityContainer with the IoCConveniton class, can be easily removed by having an adapter interface into any container. To keep things simple I am having the direct dependency on the container in the sample. From the console application we can create a new container and use the convention class to register the dependencies. The factory implementations have the expected class conventions inside them that would be used to resolve the dependencies. Since the factory is part of the composition root I am using a <a href="http://blog.ploeh.dk/2012/03/15/ImplementinganAbstractFactory/">container based factory</a>, to resolve the dependencies.</p>

<pre><code class="csharp">IUnityContainer unityContainer = new UnityContainer();
IoCConvention.RegisterByConvention(unityContainer);
</code></pre>

<p>This has really taken off a lot of work for all the developers in the team and registrations of dependencies works seamlessly. You can find the sample convention implementation <a href="https://github.com/rahulpnath/Blog/tree/master/IocConventionRegistration">here</a>. Are you using convention registrations in your applications? If not you should start using them.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Reading is inevitable to keep up to date with the latest technologies and rapid changes happening in the programming world. But technology is nothing but a tool for getting things done. What one has to understand are the concepts and principles underlying these technology and the core principles of development. These are to be gained through <a href="http://www.rahulpnath.com/blog/an-enterprise-it-project-experience/">our own experiences</a> and also from the learnings and the experiences of others. Books are a great source of such experiences, and this post is a list of those that I have found interesting and helpful. I have not read all these nor was I able to fully understand whatever I have. These books are to be read/referred to multiple times, practiced and adopted into our work. It&rsquo;s also worth referring other books from the same author&rsquo;s or other writings as they are among the pioneers in our industry.</p>

<p>The books would speak for themselves and I don&rsquo;t think I can do justice writing a summary to any of these. So I have decided to just list them down here(in no specific order). It&rsquo;s worth having a personal copy of each one of these in your bookshelves. (mine is still short of some of them).</p>

    <link href="http://rahulpnath.com/blog/using-repository-pattern-for-abstracting-data-access-from-a-cache-and-data-store/"/>
    <updated>2014-11-22T20:56:26+05:30</updated>
    <id>http://rahulpnath.com/blog/using-repository-pattern-for-abstracting-data-access-from-a-cache-and-data-store</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<blockquote><p>A Repository abstracts the persistence logic from the core business logic and allows the data to be accessed as it would have been from an in-memory object collection.</p></blockquote>

<p><a href="http://martinfowler.com/eaaCatalog/repository.html">Repository Pattern</a> is useful when you want your domain objects(or entities) to be persistence ignorant but yet have the flexibility to map your data to the choice of your data store e.g. Sql Server, Oracle, NoSQL databases, cache etc. The physical model of the stored data might vary from store to store but not the logical model. So a repository plays the role of mapping a logical model to physical model and vice versa. ORM (Object Relational Mapping) tools like <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-in/data/ef.aspx">Entity Framework</a> does help us to achieve this and we could make use of it wherever possible in building your domain specific repositories.</p>

<p>With large scale applications it is very common to have an external cache, to optimize repeated access to the data held in a data store. The repository is the ideal place to decide on populating, fetching and invalidating the cache. When building the repositories, we would not want to tightly couple ourselves with a specific cache provider or a data store provider like sql nor with any ORM tool like Entity Framework.</p>

<blockquote><p>In this blog post we will be seeing how to keep our Repositories clean and separate from the actual providers and provide a persistence ignorant data access to your business layer.</p></blockquote>

<p><img src="http://rahulpnath.com/images/RepositoryPattern.png" class="center" alt="Repository Pattern Class Diagram"></p>

<h3>Creating the Repository</h3>

<p>At the bare minimum a repository should be able to provide CRUD (Create Read Update Delete) options, for which we will have a generic interface defined and have implementation of which will be inherited from, for specific repositories.</p>

<pre><code class="csharp Repository Interface">public interface IRepository&lt;T&gt; where T : IIdentifiable
{
    IEnumerable&lt;T&gt; GetAll();
    T Delete(string id);
    T GetById(string id);
    T Insert(T entity);
    T Update(T entity);
}
</code></pre>

<p>The implementation of this interface would need to perform following functionality:</p>

<ol>
<li>Decide on whether to get the data from cache or data store and keep the data consistent.</li>
<li>Get/Modify the data from the cache</li>
<li>Get/Modify the data from the data store.</li>
</ol>


<p>Thinking of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_responsibility_principle">SRP (Single Responsibility Principle)</a>, it is best to keep these responsibilities separate so that each of them can change independently without changing the other. For this we need to further introduce 2 more interfaces, one for getting the data from the cache and one for the data store. These 2 need not be the same, as a cache would mostly work on a key value pair combination and the one for the data store would need to have the same methods as supported by the repository (You could have them as the same too in case required). As for the repository, it depends on these 2 interface implementation (which we call strategies), to get the data - CacheStrategy or DataStoreStrategy.</p>

<pre><code class="csharp Cache Strategy Interface">public interface ICacheStrategy&lt;T&gt; where T : IIdentifiable
{
    bool InsertOrUpdate(T entity);
    T Get(string id);
    bool Invalidate(string id);
}
</code></pre>

<pre><code class="csharp DataStore Strategy Interface">public interface IDataStoreStrategy&lt;T&gt; : IRepository&lt;T&gt; where T : IIdentifiable
{
}
</code></pre>

<p>We see that above, for the Cache Strategy interface I have added a set of methods that acts on the key and the value, the entity itself. For the DataStore strategy, we have the same methods coming from the IRepository interface so that we can translate them all into corresponding querying format of their storage and return the data.</p>

<p>The Sql data store strategy implementation using Entity Framework would be like below, which will have a context provided to it, that it can use for performing the queries on sql database. Will see more on the context later below.(The interface implementations are omitted below to keep it simple). A cache strategy would also look something similar and would depend on the caching provider that you use.</p>

<pre><code class="csharp SqlDataStoreStrategy">public class SqlDataStoreStrategy&lt;T&gt; : IDataStoreStrategy&lt;T&gt;
    where T : class, IIdentifiable
{
    protected readonly SqlDataStoreContext dataContext;

    protected readonly IDbSet&lt;T&gt; dbSet;

    public SqlDataStoreStrategy(IDataStoreContext dataContext)
    {
        // Since this is a specific implementation for Sql it does know about the existence of SqlDataStoreContext
        this.dataContext = dataContext as SqlDataStoreContext;
        this.dbSet = this.dataContext.Set&lt;T&gt;();
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>The Generic repository implementation will use these strategies to return the data. For example, a Get, it will first look the cache and then the data store.</p>

<pre><code class="csharp Generic Repository">public class GenericRepository&lt;T&gt; : IRepository&lt;T&gt;
    where T : IIdentifiable
{
    protected ICacheStrategy&lt;T&gt; cacheStrategy;

    protected IDataStoreStrategy&lt;T&gt; dataStoreStrategy;

    public GenericRepository(ICacheStrategy&lt;T&gt; cacheStrategy, IDataStoreStrategy&lt;T&gt; dataStoreStrategy)
    {
        this.cacheStrategy = cacheStrategy;
        this.dataStoreStrategy = dataStoreStrategy;
    }

    public T GetById(string id)
    {
        var item = this.cacheStrategy.Get(id);
        if (item != null)
        {
            return item;
        }

        item = this.dataStoreStrategy.GetById(id);
        this.cacheStrategy.InsertOrUpdate(item);

        return item;
    }
}
</code></pre>

<h3>Creating Specific Repositories</h3>

<p>There might be cases where we want to query on specific fields or combination of fields or do something that is specific for that repository. In these cases you can extend on to the repository methods. You would need to add a couple of classes for the new specific repository.</p>

<ol>
<li>Create a new repository interface and implement it.</li>
<li>Create a new data store strategy interface which implements from the new repository interface and the base data store strategy interface and implement it.</li>
<li>In case cache strategy needs an update update its interfaces too as like step 2</li>
</ol>


<pre><code class="csharp ">public interface IArticleRepository : IRepository&lt;Article&gt;
{
    IEnumerable&lt;Article&gt; GetAllArticlesByCategory(string categoryName);
}

public interface IArticleDataStoreStrategy : IDataStoreStrategy&lt;Article&gt;, IArticleRepository
{
}

public class ArticleSqlDataStoreStrategy : SqlDataStoreStrategy&lt;Article&gt;, IArticleDataStoreStrategy
{
    public ArticleSqlDataStoreStrategy(IDataStoreContext dataStoreContext) : base(dataStoreContext)
    {
    }
    public IEnumerable&lt;Article&gt; GetAllArticlesByCategory(string categoryName)
    {
        // In case this is to return a large set of items then you can create a paged response and update the
        // input also to take in the page number and number of articles in one page
        return this.dbSet.Where(a =&gt; a.Category == categoryName).ToList();
    }
}
</code></pre>

<h3>Supporting Unit Of Work</h3>

<p>There might be cases where we need to update against multiple repositories and have them all saved in one single transaction. <a href="http://martinfowler.com/eaaCatalog/unitOfWork.html">UnitOfWork</a> (UOW), is the common pattern that is used for this scenario, by passing around a context object that knows how to commit/save after a set of activities. For this support we have added the below set of interfaces.(Currently in this sample only the data store is supporting the transactions)</p>

<pre><code class="csharp">public interface IUnitOfWork : IDisposable
{
    IRepository&lt;Blog&gt; BlogRepository { get; }

    IArticleRepository ArticleRepository { get; }

    Task&lt;int&gt; SaveChangesAsync();
}


public class UnitOfWork : IUnitOfWork
{
    private IDataStoreContext dataStoreContext;

    private readonly IUnityContainer container;

    public IRepository&lt;Blog&gt; BlogRepository
        {
            get
            {
                // TODO : Use unity containers to generate the UnitOfwork so that to make sure that
                // datacontext is a single instance in that instance of uow
                return new GenericRepository&lt;Blog&gt;(
                    this.container.Resolve&lt;ICacheStrategy&lt;Blog&gt;&gt;(),
                    new SqlDataStoreStrategy&lt;Blog&gt;(this.dataStoreContext));
            }
        }

    public IArticleRepository ArticleRepository
        {
            get
            {
                 // TODO : Use unity containers to generate the UnitOfwork so that to make sure that
                // datacontext is a single instance in that instance of uow
                return new ArticleRepository(
                    this.container.Resolve&lt;ICacheStrategy&lt;Article&gt;&gt;(),
                    new ArticleSqlDataStoreStrategy(this.dataStoreContext));
            }
        }

    public UnitOfWork(IDataStoreContext dataStoreContext, IUnityContainer container)

    public async Task&lt;int&gt; SaveChangesAsync()
    {
        return await this.dataStoreContext.SaveChangesAsync();
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>The DataStoreContext is what maintains the in memory representation of the changes that we make across the repositories and finally saves it to the data store on <em>SaveChangesAsync</em>. For Sql data store we make use of the DbContext provided by Entity Framework, which already implements the same method from our interface. If you see the above sql strategy code, this is the data context that we use to perform queries and updates.</p>

<pre><code class="csharp IDataStoreContext">public interface IDataStoreContext : IDisposable
{
    Task&lt;int&gt; SaveChangesAsync();
}

public class SqlDataStoreContext : DbContext, IDataStoreContext
{
    public DbSet&lt;Blog&gt; Blogs { get; set; }

    public DbSet&lt;Article&gt; Articles { get; set; }
}
</code></pre>

<p>For a client to perform operation, it can get the repositories through the unit of work as shown below.
<code>csharp
var article = unitOfWork.ArticleRepository.GetById("1");
article.Name = "New Name";
unitOfWork.SaveChangesAsync();
</code></p>

<h3>IQueryable on your Repositories</h3>

<p>In the repository methods we return an IEnumerable and not an IQueryable, as we want all my querying logics to be contained inside the strategies that implement the real querying. We definitely do not want the querying logic to be there all across the client code accessing the repository, as that would make maintaining the code difficult. Also each of the strategies would have their own ways of querying and should be well abstracted by them. Otherwise all we end up having would be a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leaky_abstraction">leaky abstraction</a></p>

<p>By separating out the cache and data store strategies we have made it possible to change the providers for either of them without affecting any of the repository code. We could switch out the sql data store strategy and have a oracle strategy or a mongodb strategy and have that implement the specifics on how to retrieve the the data that we want. We would also have a specific IDataStoreContext implementation for the corresponding new data store.</p>

<p>You can find the code structure for this <a href="https://github.com/rahulpnath/Blog/tree/master/RepositoryPattern">here</a>. It only provides the interfaces and some mock implementations and does not connect to any data stores or cache providers. Hope this helps in architecting the repository pattern when dealing with multiple strategies to save. What are your thoughts on this?</p>
