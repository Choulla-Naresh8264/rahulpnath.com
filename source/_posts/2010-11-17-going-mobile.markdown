I have always had a interests towards developing applications for mobile.

Windows Mobile 7 promises to make me  phone developer overnight,just because I know Silverlight.Though I was not into silverligt till now,I always thought it had a great similarity to WPF.So why not give it a try.

So here I am starting my journey..which i consider to be a journey into the future,as mobiles are definitely the future..playing a more important role than what it does now.

Hold tight and follow the trail :) ......[http://rahulgoesmobile.wordpress.com/](http://rahulgoesmobile.wordpress.com/)



PS: I would still be blogging here on web/desktop technologies and maybe some thoughts of mine ;)
