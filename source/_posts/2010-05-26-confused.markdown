Its been a long time since I have last blogged.Ask me for the reason,the only one I would have is 'no time'.  
But is it the truth?  
Not sure..but still I don't have one good reason.So then what I am writing about.Am I trying to discover it through writing....hopefully yes.  
One thing is sure but, life for the past few months have been monotonous,which makes me repeat 'no time' again and again for many a things including blogging.  
Office has been quite boring,tiring and a bit irritating for the last few months.Hey but IT was your favorite ,which made you choose Computer Science stream.  
It still is.  
Then what?Is it the environment?the nature of work?is it the people?... thats bugging you.  
Won't this be the same anywhere you end up,after your 3 months notice period.Oh yeah I have put my papers,currently into the second month of notice period.So whats the big deal in all this switching if it would be back to square one in an alien place.  
Am I saying don't switch your job.love the company.stay there as long as they don't push you out.  
No.Never.  
Then what.  
Am I confusing you..Can't be sorry for that.  
  
Already I am....  
  
  
....Confused
