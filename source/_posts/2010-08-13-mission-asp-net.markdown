Its been high time I have been into windows developing..wpf mostly..I think its long enough to get a taste of the web too..thats whats hot and cooking...i guess..coz everyone is asking that.So I think I should take the plunge into it...the sooner the better.  
Bluffing away @ interviews saying i have theoretical knowledge in jsp(was trained in Java quite a while ago) blah blah blah... doesn't seem to work I guess...they say why U when I have someone having work ex in ASP itself :)  
Good Question!!!  
  
So I am on this mission...to learn ASP.net..hopefully :)  
edit:  
Got hold of some books..let's see how it goes
