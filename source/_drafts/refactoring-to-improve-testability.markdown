Nowadays whenever I code, I am trying to stick to TDD (with the test first approach) and have found it to be of great help. One of the biggest reward doing TDD is that it helps you to [stay in the flow](https://vimeo.com/97419151)
- Start of with an example, raise different commands for each day from a given date till today
- show tests
- use a separate class to do the date calculation and test that separately
- easier tests

Smells:
- difficult to write tests
- different responsibilities
- book recommendations
