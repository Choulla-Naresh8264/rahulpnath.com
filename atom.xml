    <id>http://rahulpnath.com/blog/automated-clickonce-deployment-of-a-wpf-application-using-appveyor</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This post covers the current deployment setup of <a href="https://github.com/rahulpnath/clal">CLAL</a>(Command Line Application Launcher), a desktop application, that I am building. Since it is a WPF application, it supports <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/t71a733d.aspx">ClickOnce Deployment</a> that enables to create self-updating applications which can install with minimum interaction from the user. ClickOnce supports different <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/71baz9ah.aspx">deployment strategy</a> of which distributing it through the web is quite popular as it makes software distribution easier. It works well when the software size is not large so that application installation is faster. For CLAL, there are two deployments served from Azure: <a href="http://www.rahulpnath.com/clal/Releases/commandlineapplicationlauncherui.application">Latest stable build</a> and the <a href="http://www.rahulpnath.com/clal/Latest/commandlineapplicationlauncherui.application">Current build</a>.</p>

<p>I did not want to do manually, the entire deployment process of building the solution, running all the tests, creating the ClickOnce package and pushing it up to Azure, I decided to automate this. Since <a href="https://www.appveyor.com/">Appveyor</a>, a hosted distributed continuous integration service used to build and test projects, is free for open-source projects and integrates very well with application developed on the Windows platform.</p>

<h3>Setting up Appveyor project</h3>

<p>Setting up Appveyor to read from Github is very easy. Once you authorize access to Github, Appveyor lists all the projects that you have in your Github account. After selecting a project, it creates a <a href="https://ci.appveyor.com/project/rahulpnath/clal">&lsquo;build project&rsquo;</a> for that in Appveyor, where you can control all build related activities. Appveyor automatically pulls in your latest source code from the repository, when a build triggers. Build configurations can be specified using a <a href="https://www.appveyor.com/docs/appveyor-yml">configuration file</a> (appveyor.yml) living at the repository root or using the user interface. For CLAL I exclusively use the configuration from the file and the latest version is available <a href="https://github.com/rahulpnath/clal/blob/master/appveyor.yml">here</a>.
Primarily there are two branches (<em>master</em> and <em>development</em>) on the git repository which builds as the latest stable and current build. Since these two deployments have few attributes different (like the version numbers, deployment URL, update URL), I use <a href="https://www.appveyor.com/docs/branches#conditional-build-configuration">conditional build configuration</a> to have separate configuration properties for the branches.</p>

<p>The primary things that vary for the different deployments are a few ClickOnce publishing properties, the version number, the build configurations - release/debug and the deployment locations. We will see in detail below how we handle this.</p>

</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<h3>ClickOnce Publish Profile</h3>

<p>To create the publish profile, I used the Visual Studio Publish option on the project, which generates all the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms165431.aspx#Anchor_2">Publishing Properties</a>. Most of these values remain the same across all deployment version (release and development). For the ones that are unique to the deployment version like the PublishUrl, UpdateUrl, and ApplicationVersion I removed them from <em>csproj</em> file. The deployment version specific properties is set in the Appveyor configuration file and used by the build script to set the right values.</p>

<p><img class="center" alt="ClickOnce publish settings" src="http://rahulpnath.com/images/clickonce_publishsetting.png" /></p>

<p>In the Appveyor configuration, the <a href="https://www.appveyor.com/docs/build-configuration#script-blocks-in-build-configuration">before_build</a> step these values are set as environment variables, which gets <a href="http://help.appveyor.com/discussions/questions/980-custom-msbuild-property">automatically passed into the MSBuild as Properties</a>. The certificate required for signing ClickOnce manifest gets installed during this step.</p>

</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<h3>Versioning</h3>

<p>I am using <a href="http://semver.org/">semantic versioning</a> and wanted to control the version numbers for the releases explicitly. Since ClickOnce supports only four digit version numbers, the last one always defaults to zero in the release version. For Current build (development) deployments, the fourth place is used to maintain the build number, so that I can support different build version in development. I use a <a href="https://www.appveyor.com/docs/build-configuration#build-versioning">sequential number generated by appveyor</a> and set in the configuration file.</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='yaml'><span class='line'><span class="l-Scalar-Plain">version</span><span class="p-Indicator">:</span> <span class="l-Scalar-Plain">0.2.2.{build}</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>For a  release I run the below script on the master branch, which updates the version number across the source code files and then push the changes to Github, which triggers a build to the updated version. Then I merge back the master into development so that the next build on development branch would be a build number off the latest released version. The script uses <a href="https://github.com/ploeh/ZeroToNine">ZeroToNine</a> for updating AssemblyInfo files and updates the version numbers in the Appveyor configuration files.</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>

</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<h3>Artifacts and Deployment</h3>

<p>The csproj file of the WPF application has <em>Publish</em> also as a default target, which results in a publish everytime the project is build. By default, the publish directory is in the bin folder under a subdirectory <em>app.publish</em>. Appveyor allows specifying folders as <a href="https://www.appveyor.com/docs/packaging-artifacts">artifacts</a>, which marks all the files under them as artifacts. The below script is for the latest stable build and marks it with a name &lsquo;releaseBuild&rsquo;.</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='yaml'><span class='line'> <span class="l-Scalar-Plain">after_build</span><span class="p-Indicator">:</span>
</span><span class='line'>    <span class="p-Indicator">-</span> <span class="l-Scalar-Plain">ps</span><span class="p-Indicator">:</span> <span class="l-Scalar-Plain">$root = Resolve-Path .\src\CommandLineApplicationLauncherUI\bin\Release\app.publish;</span>
</span><span class='line'>    <span class="-Error"> </span><span class="p-Indicator">[</span><span class="nv">IO.Directory</span><span class="p-Indicator">]</span><span class="l-Scalar-Plain">::GetFiles($root.Path, &#39;*.*&#39;, &#39;AllDirectories&#39;) | % { Push-AppveyorArtifact $_ -FileName $_.Substring($root.Path.Length + 1) -DeploymentName releaseBuild }</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Appveyor allows to <a href="https://www.appveyor.com/docs/deployment">deploy using multiple providers</a> and <a href="https://www.appveyor.com/docs/deployment/ftp">FTP</a> is one of them. I use this to deploy the artifcats generated to an Azure FTP from which I serve the installer. This is currently hosted on my blog domain. The password for the FTP location is <a href="https://ci.appveyor.com/tools/encrypt">encrypted using the Appveyor tool</a>. The below configuration pushes all the artifacts with the name &lsquo;releaseBuild&rsquo; to the FTP folder.</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>

<p>With each push into the Github repository now we have Appveyor listening to it, pulling the latest source code, installing the code signing certificate for ClickOnce, building and running all tests in the project, publish the ClickOnce application, packaging and deploying this to the Azure FTP. There is a completely automated deployment pipeline and makes it easy to publish updates to <a href="https://github.com/rahulpnath/clal">CLAL</a>!</p>

    <link href="http://rahulpnath.com/blog/getting-started-with-freelancing-jobs-online/"/>
    <updated>2016-03-01T11:57:00+11:00</updated>
    <id>http://rahulpnath.com/blog/getting-started-with-freelancing-jobs-online</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Freelancing is a good way to learn new technology, get some hands on experience and not getting limited to the technology stack at your full-time job and of course earn some extra money!. There is a great demand for developers out there, so if its &lsquo;legal&rsquo; (check with your employer, if you already have another full-time job) for you to freelance then give it a try. There are a lot of online freelance platforms(<a href="https://www.upwork.com/">Upwork</a>, <a href="https://www.freelancer.com/">Freelancer</a>) that connects businesses and developers remotely. These platforms enable you as a developer, to start a profile and bid for jobs of your interest. If the business/client finds you as a match for the job, then you get signed up and can start working immediately.</p>

<p>Easy right! Yes absolutely it is, but here are a few things that might help you through the journey, that I have learned from my experiences.</p>

<p><img class="center" alt="Freelancer" src="http://rahulpnath.com/images/freelancing.jpg" /></p>

<h3><strong>Finding work</strong></h3>

<p>Finding work is just an easy search across on the platforms with your preferred skills. It will be a good idea to stick to one of the platforms so that you can build up a profile and then move on to other platforms. Landing your first job as a freelancer could be tricky as clients have a tendency to look for people with some work record on the platform, which assures them that it is a &lsquo;real human&rsquo; that they are talking to. But this is kind of &lsquo;chicken and egg problem&rsquo;. One of the best way to break into your first job is to sell yourself low - Yes, you heard it right - Really low!</p>

<p>While I started on with the idea of freelancing, I took on it with the perspective of that of an experienced developer(as I had a full-time job, which was paying me decently well). I bid on all projects with a relatively higher amount or at par to that my current job was paying, until I received back the below email from one of the clients.</p>

<blockquote><p><em>You lack test scores, have a small portfolio, and have no <a href="https://www.upwork.com">Odesk</a> history. You should try to underbid and get jobs when you are building up odesk history, get good feedback and then raise your rates later.I see you have good qualifications and don&rsquo;t mean you are not worth what you charge, this is just a way to get more clients in the beginning</em></p></blockquote>

<p>It&rsquo;s not always that you get a reply like this and it was an eye-opener for me. So to get the ball rolling, I tried bidding low on a couple of bug fix project which was about 1-2 hours work. Luckily I got one of the jobs and from then followed the exact feedback that I got back - Slowly increase rates and build profile.When bidding lower always make sure that you do on projects of smaller size, so that you don&rsquo;t feel really bad selling yourself low midway through the project (you could always renegotiate, but it might affect the feedback).</p>

<h3><strong>Bidding</strong></h3>

<p>Bidding is an important part of the freelancing cycle. Make sure you put in as much details to put across that you are an ideal candidate. It&rsquo;s where your skills to sell yourself come into play. Make sure you convey through the reasons on the &lsquo;Why&rsquo;,&lsquo;What&rsquo; and &lsquo;How&rsquo; in your bid cover letter.</p>

<blockquote><p><em>Approach bidding the same way you would attend an interview with a prospective employer.</em></p></blockquote>

<ul>
<li><strong>Why</strong> you are interested in the project</li>
<li><strong>What</strong> makes you a good candidate and your experiences. It will be good to have some references to existing projects/applications/blogs to back your claims.</li>
<li><strong>How</strong> you would approach the problem at hand and some questions probing more details.</li>
</ul>


<p>Many a times we have a tendency to copy paste bid cover letters and clients might look for specific references to their project. There are also clients who ask to start/end the bid with specific words or phrases just to make sure you have at least read through the job description.</p>

<h3><strong>Communication</strong></h3>

<p>Communication is the key when working remotely. Keeping your clients/stakeholders up to date on what&rsquo;s happening in the project, calling out any risks associated and clarifying on any issues should be done promptly. Your bid cover letter is the first impression that you leave on the client on your communications skills. So that makes it an added reason to give enough time while sending out your bid.</p>

<blockquote><p><em>Missing a deadline is not really a problem, but not communicating it up front is.</em></p></blockquote>

<p>It&rsquo;s a good idea to set a rhythm to your updates and also sticking on to an update format, so that client knows how and when to expect for things. This will also allow them to plan for work. If working on hourly jobs, it would also be a good idea to set up repositories to share code or other artifacts that you are working on. <a href="https://github.com">Github</a> (paid for private repositories), <a href="https://www.visualstudio.com/en-us/products/visual-studio-team-services-vs.aspx">Visual Studio Online</a> (VSO) or <a href="https://bitbucket.org">Bitbuket</a> (free with limits for private repositories) are good providers that you can use. Using <a href="https://trello.com">Trello</a> boards or <a href="https://www.visualstudio.com/en-us/products/visual-studio-team-services-vs.aspx">VSO</a> for managing work/tasks will give enough visibility to clients on the current status at any point in time.</p>

<h3><strong>Hourly vs Fixed Price</strong></h3>

<p>When starting out it might be a good idea to start with an hourly project, so that you get introduced to various aspects of freelancing and get used to it. Once comfortable with the overall life cycle you can try fixed price projects. The challenge with fixed price projects, is in getting the scope fixed and making sure that you have accounted for all possible work. Also in tactfully raising cost variations when the client changes from agreed scope or when you discover work that you had not estimated for. Having cost change costs quite often does not put across a good message, so do that wisely and only when absolutely required. Even on hourly projects, there is nothing wrong in negotiating with the per-hour rate, especially if the project is a long running one.</p>

<p>Understand how the payment terms and conditions associated with the platform works. Some platforms have the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Escrow">escrow</a> model, so the risk of loosing out on money is less. For hourly projects, some platforms have tools that automatically track the amount of time you work on a project and directly bill the clients card once in a week/month, in which case you are sure to receive the payment (unless the client raises a conflict). For cases where none of the above applies, make sure that you have payment milestones set at different phases of the project and you share the code/working product only once you receive payments for milestones. Sharing videos, pictures, live remote sessions could be some alternatives to prove milestone criteria.</p>

<h3><strong>Branding</strong></h3>

<p>Proving your metal is tough if you are just starting out freelancing. Having some experiences to show case is valuable when bidding for projects. When I started off freelancing, my intention was to learn Windows Phone and Windows 8 Modern application development. Since the platform was relatively new then, I started off with a side project <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/store/apps/picfinity/9wzdncrdwxx8">Picfinity</a>, to showcase my capabilities. Building the application also helped me generate a <a href="http://www.rahulpnath.com/blog/tag/500px/">few blog posts</a> around these areas and I used both of above to showcase my ability to build applications for the Windows platform. This also helped me increase my hourly rates at a faster pace.
Branding is an ongoing effort that you need to do when freelancing, which indirectly enables you to increase your rates over time. <a href="http://www.rahulpnath.com/blog/get-started-with-your-blog/">Writing blogs</a>, creating reusable libraries, contributing on forums, etc. are some of the things that help with this.</p>

<p>From the experiences gained from these freelancing platforms you will soon be able to move to consulting on your own or join premium freelancing platforms like <a href="www.toptal.com">Toptal</a>, <a href="http://x-team.com/">Xteam</a>, etc. You could also stick on with these platforms and learn new technologies while getting paid. At the very least I see that it has helped me generate content for my blogs (as I still struggle with topics to blog about).</p>

<p>Hope this helps you to get started with freelancing!</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Azure Key Vault service is a cloud hosted, HSM(Hardware Security Modules)-backed service for managing cryptographic keys and other secrets. With Azure Key Vault, the process of managing and controlling the keys required for an application or multiple applications for an enterprise can be handled at a centralized place. If you are new to Key Vault, read the <a href="http://www.rahulpnath.com/blog/getting-started-with-azure-key-vault/">Getting Started with Azure Key Vault</a>. Access to Key Vault is primarily using <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dn868052.aspx">PowerShell</a> or the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/azure/dn903609.aspx">REST API</a>. There are client API libraries available for <a href="https://github.com/Azure">various platforms</a> that wraps around the REST API, including one for <a href="https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-java/tree/master/services/keyvault">Java</a>. There have been some asks from my blog readers on how to use the Java SDK as there are no samples available, and this post is a result of that!</p>

<p>The Java Key Vault SDK provides a <a href="https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-java/blob/8bd59520544cf7471f8b3c2e3f9e577e68ff2852/services/keyvault/azure-keyvault/src/main/java/com/microsoft/azure/keyvault/KeyVaultClientService.java">KeyVaultClientService</a> to create a <a href="https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-java/blob/8bd59520544cf7471f8b3c2e3f9e577e68ff2852/services/keyvault/azure-keyvault/src/main/java/com/microsoft/azure/keyvault/KeyVaultInternalClientImpl.java">KeyVaultClient</a>, to interact  with the Key Vault. The SDK is available as a Maven package and is available for download <a href="http://search.maven.org/#search%7Cga%7C1%7Ckeyvault">here</a>. Setting up a project to try this will be a quickie for someone who is already working on Java, but I struggled a bit with the IDE and getting the packages into the project. (Likely the sample solution attached at the end is not the best way to get things working, but it works!. Do drop by a comment if there are better/easier ways.)</p>

<p><a href="http://www.rahulpnath.com/blog/authenticating-a-client-application-with-azure-key-vault/">Authenticating a client application with Azure Key Vault</a> is using an Azure AD application. You can create an AD application either from the portal or use <a href="http://www.rahulpnath.com/blog/how-the-deprecation-of-switch-azuremode-affects-azure-key-vault/">PowerShell cmdlets</a>. In this example I am using the client/Secret authentication mechanism, but it is recommended to use certificate-based authentication, so you do not have to put the secret in your source files. The KeyVaultClientService needs a <a href="https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-java/blob/8bd59520544cf7471f8b3c2e3f9e577e68ff2852/services/keyvault/azure-keyvault/src/main/java/com/microsoft/azure/keyvault/KeyVaultConfiguration.java">KeyVaultConfiguration</a> object, which in turn needs the Credentials to connect to the KeyVault. There is an abstract implementation available for <a href="https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-java/blob/8bd59520544cf7471f8b3c2e3f9e577e68ff2852/services/keyvault/azure-keyvault/src/main/java/com/microsoft/azure/keyvault/authentication/KeyVaultCredentials.java">KeyVaultCredentials</a> available which implements CloudCredentials and supports automatic bearer token refresh. Inheriting this we can create support for the clientid/secret authentication as shown below. I use the <a href="https://github.com/AzureAD/azure-activedirectory-library-for-java">Microsoft Azure Active Directory Authentication Library (ADAL) for Java</a> to authenticate against the AD application, which is again available as a <a href="http://search.maven.org/#search%7Cga%7C1%7Cg%3A%22com.microsoft.aad%22">Maven package</a>.</p>

<p>Using the above we can create a KeyVaultClient instance to connect to Key Vault. The KeyVaultClient supports all operations with the vault. The below sample uses a Key Vault key to encrypt a data and then to decrypt it back.</p>

Now that it is deprecated we have updated versions of the PowerShell cmdlets to manage <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/key-vault/">Azure Key Vault</a>. This post revisits all the scripts used in the <a href="http://www.rahulpnath.com/blog/category/azure-key-vault/">previous Key Vault posts</a> and provides the updated scripts.</p>

<p>Most of the scripts have the only change of having an extra &lsquo;Rm&rsquo; indicating that those were off the Resource Manager.</p>

    <link href="http://rahulpnath.com/blog/setting-up-autohotkey-to-speed-up-trivial-tasks/"/>
    <updated>2016-02-09T04:22:00+11:00</updated>
    <id>http://rahulpnath.com/blog/setting-up-autohotkey-to-speed-up-trivial-tasks</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>A lot of trivial tasks that we do daily on our computer can be automated to make it faster and reduce the number of keystrokes (<a href="http://www.keysleft.com">as they are limited</a>). <a href="https://autohotkey.com/">AutoHoykey</a>(AHK) is an excellent tool to automate a lot of these and is <a href="http://www.rahulpnath.com/blog/tools-that-I-use/">one of my favorite tool</a>. I use a very limited set of functionality of AHK,  to set up hot strings, launch applications, and mapping caps lock as backspace. The installer to the latest version is available <a href="https://autohotkey.com/download/ahk-install.exe">here</a>.</p>

<blockquote><p>&ldquo;AutoHotkey (AHK) is a free, open-source macro-creation and automation software for Windows that allows users to automate repetitive tasks. It is driven by a scripting language that was initially aimed at providing keyboard shortcuts, otherwise known as hotkeys, that over time evolved into a full-fledged scripting language.&rdquo;</p></blockquote>

<p><strong>Hotstrings</strong> are to map short key combinations that expand on completion. This one is to handle all common phrases, words like emails, default mail replies, etc. Defining a hotstring is as shown below or look up the <a href="https://autohotkey.com/docs/Hotstrings.htm">documentation here</a> for more details</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='text'><span class='line'>::emg::rahulpnath@gmail.com
</span><span class='line'>::myn::Rahul P Nath
</span><span class='line'>::myb::http://www.rahulpnath.com
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>You can use some easy to remember keywords for these like emg means &lsquo;Email Gmail&rsquo; and myn means &lsquo;My Name&rsquo; etc.</p>

<p><strong>Hot keys</strong> are to launch applications on those key combinations. You can use this to launch your favorite applications with the key combinations of your choice. Defining  hot keys is as shown below or look up the <a href="https://autohotkey.com/docs/Hotkeys.htm">documentation here</a> for more details</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='text'><span class='line'>^!C::
</span><span class='line'>Run &quot;C:\Users\rahulpnath\Documents\Apps\cmder\Cmder.exe&quot;
</span><span class='line'>return
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p><strong>Capslock to Backspace</strong> mapping is something that I got inspired from the <a href="http://colemak.com/">Colemak layout</a> and find it useful even with the QWERTY layout. I use the <a href="https://autohotkey.com/docs/commands/Send.htm">Send</a> command to send simulated keystrokes. In the rare case of actually needing the CapsLock key, I just need to press it along with Shift to toggle on and off.</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='text'><span class='line'>CapsLock:: Send {BackSpace}
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<h4><strong>Running AHK scripts on startup</strong></h4>

<p>To automatically run these scripts on startup, I use the <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-au/windows/schedule-task#1TC=windows-7">Task Scheduler</a> that comes with Windows. To create a new task follow the steps as shown below.</p>

<p>In Task Scheduler select &lsquo;Create Task&rsquo; and enter the Name and Description. Set it to run with highest privileges, so that the scripts work even when on application&rsquo;s running in admin mode. Create a trigger for the task to run and I have set it &lsquo;At log on&rsquo; to run every time I log on. Create an Action to &lsquo;Start a program&rsquo; and select the script file (.ahk) with all your scripts. Once created you can right-click on the task and select Run and verify that the script has started and is working.</p>

<p><img class="center" alt="Visual Studio Code Coverage" src="http://rahulpnath.com/images/ahk_task_general.PNG" /></p>

<p><img class="center" alt="Visual Studio Code Coverage" src="http://rahulpnath.com/images/ahk_task_trigger.PNG" /></p>

<p><img class="center" alt="Visual Studio Code Coverage" src="http://rahulpnath.com/images/ahk_task_actions.PNG" /></p>

<p>I synchronize these scripts over Onedrive, to make it available on all my computers. The only thing to do on all the computers is to create the startup task. The features discussed above is just the tip of an iceberg, and should help you get started. AHK has a lot more features that you can explore at the project site. Hope this helps you to set up and automate some of your tasks!</p>

    <link href="http://rahulpnath.com/blog/optimizing-octopress-workflow-for-new-posts/"/>
    <updated>2016-01-20T22:51:03+11:00</updated>
    <id>http://rahulpnath.com/blog/optimizing-octopress-workflow-for-new-posts</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Over the past month I had thought of migrating this blog to Hugo, a static site generator that is faster than the current one, Octopress. Lack of workflow for creating new posts and slower build times were the main reasons. I am the kind of person when writing post want to see often, how it looks like on the real site. With the current number of posts it takes around 40-50 seconds to build the entire site and it makes me to wander off to something else while the build is happening - at times it takes a long time to get back to writing!. But migrating to a new platform has a lot of challenges and time-consuming and I did not want to invest my time in that, so though of looking out for ways to optimize the current process. A bit of googling and playing around with Ruby, solved both of the major issues and I have an improved workflow!</p>

<h4><strong>Draft workflow</strong></h4>

<p>I was lucky to find this <a href="http://neverstopbuilding.com/how-to-enhance-your-octopress-draft-and-heroku-deploy-process">post</a> which handled most of the draft workflow process. Most of the code below is used from there with a very few minor additions. Newer versions of Jekyll support <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/docs/drafts/">working with drafts</a> and uses the &lsquo;<em>&ndash;drafts</em>&rsquo; switch to build the drafts (instead of using published flag as in thr above linked post), that are in &lsquo;<em>_drafts</em>&rsquo; folder. Drafts are posts which does not have date&rsquo;s, so I added in a placeholder text, &lsquo;<em>thisIsStillADraft</em>&rsquo;, in the yaml front matter of the post which will later be replaced with the post publish date. Also added in the code to open the default writer with the newly created post</p>

<p>The publish draft task just asks for the post to publish and replaces the placeholder text with the current date time. Also it moves the post from the &lsquo;<em>_drafts</em>&rsquo; folder to the &lsquo;<em>_posts</em>&rsquo; folder with the file name appended with the date time. Since I run this just before deploying a post, the date on the post will be the actual publish date, and not the date I started writing the post (usually writing a  post spans over multiple days).</p>

<p>With these two new rake tasks, I can now create as many draft posts at a time and publish them once ready.</p>

<h4><strong>Improving the build time</strong></h4>

<p>Jekyll build command options provides a switch, &lsquo;<em>configuration</em>&rsquo;, that allows to pass a configuration file instead of using &lsquo;<em>_config.yml</em>&rsquo;. In the configuration file we can specify a &lsquo;exclude&rsquo; option to exclude the directories and/or files from the build. I created a new task for building only the current drafts, by specifying the &lsquo;<em>&ndash;drafts</em>&rsquo; switch and a dynamically generated configuration file, <em>_previewconfig.yml</em>, which excludes the &lsquo;<em>_posts</em>&rsquo; folder. This dramatically increases the build time, and completes almost immediately after a making a change to a post. This fits perfectly into my workflow, as while writing new posts I do not want to see any already published posts. You can  add the dynamically generated configuration file name to the <em>.gitignore</em> as I do not delete it in the tasks. I did not want to use the &lsquo;<em>rake isolate</em>&rsquo; task that is already present in the  rakefile, as that does not integrate with the draft workflow and unnecessarily moves all the posts to a temporary place.</p>

<h4><strong>Dropbox integration</strong></h4>

<p>At times, I have started to draft blog posts while commuting to work from my mobile device, so I wanted to sync my draft posts to <a href="https://db.tt/bvYw3pL6">Dropbox</a>, so that I can edit it from my <a href="http://www.rahulpnath.com/blog/review-two-months-and-counting-android-and-nexus-5/">mobile phone</a>. Apps like <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.keepzero.markdrop&amp;hl=en">MarkDrop</a>/<a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.keepzero.markdrop&amp;hl=en">JotterPad</a> integrates with Dropbox and supports Markdown editing. I set up a drafts folder on my Dropbox folder on laptop, which is automatically synced using the <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/install">Dropbox application</a>. I then used <a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc753194.aspx">Mklink</a> to create a symbolic link from the folder on Dropbox to my drafts folder in my blog repository. Whenever a new draft post is added, it gets automatically inserted into the Dropbox folder, which will then be synced to cloud and available for edit on my mobile phone too. (Part of this post is written from my mobile!)</p>

<h4><strong>Cmder integration</strong></h4>

<p><a href="http://cmder.net/">Cmder</a> is a portable console emulator for Windows and provides a good nice looking feature rich console experience on Windows and is one of my <a href="http://www.rahulpnath.com/blog/tools-that-I-use/">favourite tools</a>. Creating alias for commands is one of the features, that allows to create a short key combination for an otherwise long command. You can use this to create commands for the task in Octopress like below</p>

    <link href="http://rahulpnath.com/blog/organizing-tests-into-test-suites-for-visual-studio/"/>
    <updated>2016-01-18T22:51:03+11:00</updated>
    <id>http://rahulpnath.com/blog/organizing-tests-into-test-suites-for-visual-studio</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>While working with large code base, that has a lot of tests (unit, integration, acceptance etc), running all of them every time we make a small  change (if you are doing TDD or just using build for feedback) takes a lot of time. Organizing tests into different test suites, making it easier to run as required by the current context, is handy in such cases.</p>

<p>There are multiple ways that we can do this within Visual Studio and below are some of the options available. I tend to use a mix of all these in my current project. This gives the flexibility to run only the new tests that I am writing while writing new code or set of related tests for the updates that I am making. Once done with the changes, I can run the full suite of unit tests, followed by the integration tests. This reduces the interruption duration while coding and has a direct impact on the overall productivity too. (If you think small interruptions does not matter much think twice!)</p>

<p><img class="center" alt="Geek productivity" src="http://rahulpnath.com/images/geek_productivity.jpg" /></p>

<h4><strong>Test Traits</strong></h4>

<p>Traits are a good way to group tests together and to run them as different suites. It encompasses TestCategory, TestProperty, Priority and Owner. Using <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-au/library/microsoft.visualstudio.testtools.unittesting.testcategoryattribute.aspx">TestCategory</a> attribute we can specify  the group of the test and the Visual Studio Test Explorer uses this value to group the tests and allows executing tests in specific groups.</p>

<p><img class="center" alt="Visual Studio Test Traits" width="75%" src="http://rahulpnath.com/images/vs_testExplorer_traits.png" /></p>

<p>Limitation with the above approach is that it depends on developers to put these attributes on the test cases or class level and not leveraging any existing conventions that might be already in place. Having integration tests, unit tests, acceptance tests in different projects is a very common practice, with conventions like project names ending with &lsquo;.UnitTests, .IntegrationTests, .AcceptanceTests&rsquo; etc.</p>

<h4><strong>Build Tasks and Task Runner Explorer</strong></h4>

<p>The <a href="https://visualstudiogallery.msdn.microsoft.com/8e1b4368-4afb-467a-bc13-9650572db708">Task Runner Explorer</a> (TRE) provides custom task runner support to Visual Studio, allowing to run grunt/gulp task or target inside Visual Studio. Grunt/Gulp has packages for most of the unit testing frameworks, using which different build tasks can be created. To select the tests to execute different conventions can also be used. Below is an example of a gulp task to execute all the c# unit tests in the project.</p>

<p>Similarly we can have multiple tasks to execute different groups of tests and it will be available in the TRE within Visual Studio as shown below. This approach gives the most flexibility, allowing tests be grouped any way and providing ability to execute tests across the stack of technologies.

<h4><strong>Tests Settings File</strong></h4>

<p>Creating Test Playlist is an easy way to group tests into a playlist and executing them as  group. From the Test Explorer, select the tests to be grouped and on right-click, the option to create playlist is available. The saved playlists can be selected from the drop down menu on the top bar for later execution.</p>

<p><img class="center" alt="Visual Studio Test Playlist" src="http://rahulpnath.com/images/vs_testExplorer_playlist.png" /></p>

<p>This works well for short-lived groupings, when we are actively working on a part of the code and need to execute tests for that area. Every time a new test is added, we need to add it explicitly to the playlist if required.</p>

<p>We have seen multiple ways of grouping tests into test suites, and each of them comes handy in different situations. For project wide convention tests, I tend to use build tasks that integrate with TRE as it is more flexible and extendable. Do you use any other ways to group your tests, drop in with a comment!</p>

    <updated>2015-12-25T23:30:07+11:00</updated>
    <id>http://rahulpnath.com/blog/learning-typescript-setting-up-the-environment</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<blockquote><p>TypeScript is  superset of JavaScript and compiles to clean JavaScript output.</p></blockquote>

<p><a href="http://www.typescriptlang.org/">TypeScript</a> has been around for some time and is gaining more traction these days with more and more projects embracing it. The latest addition to the list <a href="https://angular.io/">Angular 2</a>, which is a very popular JavaScript framework. TypeScript brings in more structure to the way JavaScript is written and maintained. Being a compiled language, errors will be found as the code is written and not waiting till run time. Ease of refactoring and rich tooling support makes TypeScript a perfect choice for large-scale projects. TypeScript also provides improved code readability and organizing capabilities. The official documentation is a good starting point to get started with TypeScript and get some hands-on experience using <a href="http://www.typescriptlang.org/Playground">Playground</a>, which shows the compiled JavaScript real-time in browser. If you are like me, who would prefer a similar experience, but in you favourite editor then this post explains how to set up the environment for playing around with TypeScript and seeing the real-time compiled JavaScript.</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Create folder</strong> To start with lets first create a folder to work in. In this example I would be using npm(Node Package Manager) to get all the required packages. If you are new to Node, then head off to <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/">here</a> to get started and install the runtime before continuing on.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>npm init</strong> Once done with the node setup, run the <a href="https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/init">init</a> command, within the project folder (created above), to initialize the node project. This prompts a series of questions and creates a <em>package.json</em> file with the entered options.</p></li>
<li><strong>npm install -g typescript</strong> If you already have TypeScript installed (which comes in default with Visual Studio 2013 Update 2 onwards) then you can skip this step. If not, run &lsquo;npm install -g typescript&rsquo;, which will install it into the global scope.</li>
<li><strong>Hello World from TypeScript</strong> With the compiler setup, we are good to write out first hello world, for which we create a file with .ts extension.</li>
</ul>


<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='javascript'><span class='line'><span class="kd">function</span> <span class="nx">HelloWorld</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">name</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="nx">string</span><span class="p">){</span>
</span><span class='line'>    <span class="nx">alert</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">&#39;Hello World &#39;</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="nx">name</span><span class="p">);</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="p">}</span>
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'><span class="nx">HelloWorld</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">&quot;TypeScript&quot;</span><span class="p">);</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>To compile this manually we need to run the TypeScript compiler (which we installed in the previous step). The below command will compile the TypeScript file into JavaScript and output into the same folder.</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='text'><span class='line'>tsc HelloWorld.ts
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='javascript'><span class='line'><span class="kd">function</span> <span class="nx">HelloWorld</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">name</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span>
</span><span class='line'>    <span class="nx">alert</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">&#39;Hello &#39;</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="nx">name</span><span class="p">);</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="p">}</span>
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'><span class="nx">HelloWorld</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">&quot;TypeScript&quot;</span><span class="p">);</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<ul>
<li><strong>Automating the compilation</strong> To prevent running the above step every time we make a change to the typescript file, we can automate the build step. The tsc has a compiler switch to watch the file for changes and automatically compile every time a change happens. For this run the above command with a &lsquo;<em>&ndash;watch</em>&rsquo; command.</li>
</ul>


<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='text'><span class='line'>tsc HelloWorld.ts --watch
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>
<img class="center" alt="Visual Studio Code Coverage" src="http://rahulpnath.com/images/tsc_options.png" /></p>

<p>The watch switch is only available in the later versions of the compiler. To check whether your version supports it, run tsc alone which will show all the supported commands. If you do not see the watch switch as shown above, you will need to update the TypeScript compiler version. For this check the environment variables to see the path to your current compiler. If this has a path to an older version (possibly to one that Visual Studio installed at <em>Program Files (x86)\Microsoft SDKs\TypeScript</em>), then remove it. Now do a fresh install using npm, to install the latest version.</p>

<p>Open up both the TypeScript file and the generated JavaScript file in your favorite editor and you will see real-time updates to the JavaScript code, when you update the TypeScript code.<br/>
<img class="center" alt="Visual Studio Code Coverage" src="http://rahulpnath.com/images/TypeScript.gif" /></p>

<p>Hope this helps you with setting up the development environment to learn TypeScript!</p>

    <link href="http://rahulpnath.com/blog/managing-user-permissions-for-key-vault/"/>
    <updated>2015-10-11T01:08:17+11:00</updated>
    <id>http://rahulpnath.com/blog/managing-user-permissions-for-key-vault</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<blockquote><p>Please check <a href="http://www.rahulpnath.com/blog/how-the-deprecation-of-switch-azuremode-affects-azure-key-vault/">here</a> for scripts using the latest PowerShell cmdlets.</p></blockquote>

<p>Granting access to different users to manage the key vault would be a typical scenario in an organization. This could either be to create new vaults or manage keys and secrets within an existing key vault. One way to do that would be to create an <a href="http://www.rahulpnath.com/blog/authenticating-a-client-application-with-azure-key-vault/">AD application and use that to manage the vault</a>. Alternatively you would also want to add users to your azure subscription and grant them access for this (which was exactly what one of my readers wanted to achieve and reached out to me for).</p>

<p>In this post we will see how we can add a new user and grant him the required permissions. The permissions to be provided would differ based on your requirement, so you would want to modify them as required.</p>

<h4><strong>Creating the user</strong></h4>

<p><a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/articles/active-directory-create-users/">Creating a new user to the azure subscription</a> can easily be done from the <a href="https://manage.windowsazure.com">management portal</a>. We need to create the user in the azure subscription, as any resource in the subscription can be accessed only after authenticating against the Active Directory (AD) associated with it.</p>

<blockquote><p>Every Azure subscription is associated with an Azure Active Directory (AD) and needs to be authenticated with, before any of its resources can be used.</p></blockquote>

<p>Azure Key Vault gets created in the default AD associated with the subscription, so we need to add the new user to that. (If you are not sure on how to find the default AD <a href="http://www.rahulpnath.com/blog/authenticating-a-client-application-with-azure-key-vault/">this post</a> describes it in the beginning). In the portal under the <em>Azure Directory</em> option, select the default directory and on the <em>Users</em> tab, we can add a new user.</p>

<p><img src="http://rahulpnath.com/images/ad_add_user.png" class="center"></img></p>

<p>When creating the user, you can <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/articles/active-directory-assign-admin-roles/">assign the role required</a> based on the requirement. In this case I have added the user to a &lsquo;<em>User</em>&rsquo; role, as I do not want this user to have any administrative access to the my azure subscriptions or resources.</p>

<h4><strong>Creating the key vault</strong></h4>

<p>To create a key vault that we want to give permissions for the user, the below powershell scripts can be used. If you are new to key vault, then check out the <a href="http://www.rahulpnath.com/blog/getting-started-with-azure-key-vault/">Getting Started with Azure  Key Vault</a> or <a href="http://www.rahulpnath.com/blog/category/azure-key-vault/">other related articles</a>.</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='powershell'><span class='line'><span class="k">Switch</span><span class="n">-AzureMode</span> <span class="n">AzureResourceManager</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="nb">New-AzureResourceGroup</span> <span class="err">–</span><span class="n">Name</span> <span class="s1">&#39;SharedGroup&#39;</span> <span class="err">–</span><span class="n">Location</span> <span class="s1">&#39;East Asia&#39;</span>

</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>The above scripts creates the key vault under the &lsquo;<em>SharedGroup</em>&rsquo;. <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/articles/resource-group-overview/#resource-groups">Resource Groups</a> are logical containers, used to group resources together as required. <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/articles/role-based-access-control-configure/">Access to azure resources</a> can be assigned at any of the three levels (subscription, resource group or resource) and it inherits down the hierarchy as shown below. Roles can be assigned specifically to a resource, or to resource group (which would mean all to all resources in that group) or at the subscription level (which would apply to all resources/resource groups in that subscription.).</p>

<p><a href="https://acomdpsstorage.blob.core.windows.net/dpsmedia-prod/azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/articles/role-based-access-control-configure/20151006095042/rbacassignmentscopes.png"><img src="http://rahulpnath.com/images/rbac_assignment_scopes.png" class="center"></img></a></p>

<h4><strong>Setting Permission on the resource group</strong></h4>

<p>As an administrator I want the newly created user to have permission to interact with the key vault, but not create new or delete existing vaults. I would also want to give the user ability to modify keys and secrets within the vault. Currently since the new user does not have any rights, we should first give him rights to see the vaults in the <em>SharedGroup</em>. For this a <em>Reader</em> role from the set of <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/articles/role-based-access-control-configure/#built-in-roles">built in roles</a> can be assinged, through the new azure portal or powershell.</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='powershell'><span class='line'><span class="nb">New-AzureRoleAssignment</span> <span class="n">-Mail</span> <span class="n">keyvaultuser</span><span class="nv">@domain</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">onmicrosoft</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">com</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="n">-RoleDefinitionName</span> <span class="n">Reader</span> <span class="n">-ResourceGroupName</span> <span class="n">SharedGroup</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p><img src="http://rahulpnath.com/images/resource_group_permission.png" class="center"></img></p>

<p>To modify objects (keys/secrets) in the key vault we need to run <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dn903607.aspx">Set-AzureKeyVaultAccessPolicy</a> cmdlet with the required permissions, to grant access for the user. In the below script the user is given all Permissions to both keys and secrets, and this again depends on your requirement.</p>

<p>The newly created user now has full access on the key vault and only that. He can only add/remove objects within the key vault and see resources within the SharedGroup. This way the administrator can be rest assured that no other sensitive information or accesses is being shared accidentally. Periodically revisiting these permissions and revoking unnecessary accesses is recommended!</p>

    <updated>2015-10-10T06:44:19+11:00</updated>
    <id>http://rahulpnath.com/blog/tools-that-I-use</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Tools are an indispensable part of our daily life and we all have our own likes and dislikes for them. Here are a list that I use (almost daily), most of them influenced from the <a href="http://www.hanselman.com/tools">greater list</a>. Having a great keyboard support is something that I look out for, especially for those that I interact with more frequently (IDE&rsquo;s or code editors). Couple of days back, while having a chat with my friend <a href="https://twitter.com/zpbappi">Bappi</a> some of these came up and he found a few interesting, so though of sharing the list over here.</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong><a href="https://www.visualstudio.com/">Visual Studio</a></strong>: This one is almost daily and is one of them that gets on along with my laptop. For a Microsoft stack developer I do not think there are much alternatives(<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/web/webmatrix/">WebMatrix</a>, <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/">Visual Studio Code</a>) if you are looking for full fledged development. Personally I am on VS2015 now(since I am lucky enough to have a free MSDN subscription), but being on any of the version is equally good.</p></li>
<li><p><strong><a href="https://www.onenote.com/">One Note</a></strong>: For note taking I prefer OneNote as it is easy to manage and organize and is available on all platforms. Collaborating with multiple users is also so easy and comes loaded with features making it suitable for all kinds of scenarios.</p></li>
<li><p><strong><a href="https://onedrive.live.com/about/en-in/">OneDrive</a>/<a href="https://db.tt/bvYw3pL6">Dropbox</a></strong>: I use a mix of OneDrive and Dropbox for backing up my data and photos and find the experience for both good on all devices.</p></li>
<li><p><strong><a href="http://cmder.net/">Cmder</a></strong>: Looking out for a cool console in Windows, then this is the one! Loads of features and awesome color scheme makes it really one of the best consoles. Ctrl + C for copy and Ctrl + V works nicely on this(and you do not need to be on Windows 10 for this) and that alone would drive me to try out this one.</p></li>
<li><p><strike><strong><a href="http://www.sublimetext.com/">Sublime Text</a></strong>: As the tag-line says, this is &lsquo;<em>The text editor that you would fall in love with</em>&rsquo;. I use this primarily for all my writing (except for markdown formats, for which I use <a href="http://markdownpad.com/">MarkdownPad</a>), quick edits, formatting and even for some coding when I do not want the full power of Visual Studio. There are loads of plugins available and a good community of users backing it.</strike>
<strong><a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/">Visual Studio Code</a></strong>: The experience on VS Code has dramatically improved from the day that I originally wrote the post. Code is now my one stop editor and I use it for my blogging too.</p></li>
<li><p><strong><a href="https://todoist.com/">Todoist</a></strong>: I have tried out a lot of tools and finally ended up with the premium version of Todoist for task management. Its got everything right and highly flexible to organize your tasks and has full fledged apps on all platforms, browsers and even mail integration. Its almost easy to access Todoist from any context that I am working on and syncs across all devices seamlessly. Its really worth paying for this one, if not you could use the free version with some reduced features.</p></li>
<li><p><strong><a href="http://www.autohotkey.com/">AHK</a></strong>: This tiny little tool has innumerous uses and capabilities, but I just use very few of it to automate certain mundane tasks, store a list of <a href="http://ahkscript.org/docs/Hotstrings.htm">hotstring</a> and application <a href="http://ahkscript.org/docs/Hotkeys.htm">shortcut keys</a>. I have all my scripts synced across multiple PC&rsquo;s and have added a task in <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-au/windows/schedule-task#1TC=windows-7">Task Scheduler</a> to run the scripts with highest privileges every time I log on.</p></li>
<li><p><strong><a href="https://agilebits.com/onepassword">1Password</a></strong>: It&rsquo;s a password manager and is available on all platforms and quite easy to get started with. I had been using the browser capabilities to store and sync passwords before which was working fine. But password managers solve a totally different problem of generating passwords (though they also sync generated passwords without which it would be more difficult to use them given that we have multiple devices these days) as a <a href="http://www.troyhunt.com/2011/03/only-secure-password-is-one-you-cant.html">secure password is one that you cannon remember</a>. 1Password has a one time fee for license, can shared by up to six family members living in the same household, has various synchronization options and mainly gives you the control where all the data is stored.</p></li>
<li><p><strong><a href="http://www.noisli.com/">Noisli</a>,<a href="https://soundcloud.com/">SoundCloud</a></strong>: Like to here music or have some background noise then these are for you. Noisli is a background noise generator, and lets you create different different combinations for your taste. SoundCloud has a lot of music tracks in them and it is free for online streaming.</p></li>
<li><p><strong><a href="http://www.telerik.com/fiddler">Fiddler</a></strong>: The free web debugging proxy for any browser, system or platform, this one is really an indispensable tool if you are doing any kind of web development.</p></li>
<li><p><strong><a href="https://feedly.com/">Feedly</a>,<a href="https://getpocket.com/a/">Pocket</a></strong>: Feedly is an RSS reader and has got quite a good UI and syncs across all devices and helps me keep all the reading list in one place. If you want to have some articles to read while offline then Pocket is for you. Pocket downloads the article while online onto devices and keeps it available for reading. I have been experimenting (for a little over a month) to go offline on mobile and use this for my offline reading if I don&rsquo;t have the Kindle.(The experiment is going pretty good if not for a very few times I had to turn connectivity on for finding bus routes and timings.)</p></li>
<li><p><strong><a href="http://www.scootersoftware.com/">Beyond Compare</a></strong>: Really its &lsquo;beyond&rsquo; just comparing files and is really useful for comparing and merging files. I use the pro version and really recommend it. Integrates nicely with Visual Studio and other IDE&rsquo;s and also provides context menu&rsquo;s on file explorer.</p></li>
<li><p><del>Resharper</del>: I had been using this on and off and realized that mostly I was using only the &lsquo;navigate to&rsquo; feature and decided on to start using the in built features of Visual Studio. <a href="https://twitter.com/ploeh">Mark Seemann</a> has quite an interesting <a href="http://blog.ploeh.dk/2013/02/04/BewareofProductivityTools/">article</a> on this and I couldn&rsquo;t agree any more. Resharper is also changing their licensing model going from a one time fee to a <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/toolbox/">monthly fee</a>, which I don&rsquo;t personally prefer especially for a tool like R#.</p></li>
</ul>


<p>While there are some more, this is what I use most of the time. What tools help you at work. Do you have any better alternatives that I could try to replace something on this list.</p>

    <id>http://rahulpnath.com/blog/msdn-magazine-article-on-azure-key-vault</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>My first article on MSDN Magazine is published in the September 2015 edition and is available for <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/magazine/mt422585">reading online</a>. The article titled, &lsquo;<em>Microsoft Azure - Protect Sensitive Information with Azure Key Vault</em>&rsquo;, discusses on common problems in storing sensitive information in applications, benefits of Azure Key Vault and how we can quickly setup and start using it.</p>

<p>It was a great experience working with the MSDN magazine team, and got to learn a lot of things. Also special thanks to <a href="https://twitter.com/amitbapat">Amit Bapat</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/sumedhbarde">Sumedh Barde</a> for doing the technical review and clarifying certain things for the article.</p>

    <link href="http://rahulpnath.com/blog/managing-azure-ad-application-for-key-vault/"/>
    <updated>2015-06-27T23:43:48+10:00</updated>
    <id>http://rahulpnath.com/blog/managing-azure-ad-application-for-key-vault</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<blockquote><p>Please check <a href="http://www.rahulpnath.com/blog/how-the-deprecation-of-switch-azuremode-affects-azure-key-vault/">here</a> for scripts using the latest PowerShell cmdlets.</p></blockquote>

<p>Access to the Key Vault is secured using AD application token, as we had seen in the &lsquo;<a href="http://www.rahulpnath.com/blog/authenticating-a-client-application-with-azure-key-vault/">Authenticating a Client Application with Azure Key Vault</a>&rsquo;. Quite often administrators require to manage the AD application created, performing activities like creating new AD applications, changing the certificate used to authenticate with the AD application, remove a certificate or even delete an application. All of these are possible using PowerShell scripts and administrators can even run this as part of their automation scripts. With the latest Azure PowerShell version(0.9.2 or higher), the Key Vault cmdlet&rsquo;s are included automatically and does not require any additional installations. For managing the Azure AD application we need to <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/azure/jj151815.aspx#bkmk_installmodule">install the Azure AD module for PowerShell</a> and import them into the PowerShell command prompt.</p>

<h4><strong>Creating AD application</strong></h4>

<p>The <em><a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dn986794.aspx">New-AzureADApplication</a></em> cmdlet is used to create a new Azure AD application. It also provides an option to specify the certificate details used to authenticate with the AD application at the time of creation itself. This can be done as a separate step if required, which is shown later in the post.</p>

<p>First we need a certificate that is to be used for authenticating against the AD application, for which I use the below commands to generate a test certificate</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='text'><span class='line'>makecert -sv mykey.pvk -n &quot;cn=AD Test Vault Application&quot; ADTestVaultApplication.cer -b 03/03/2014 -e 06/05/2017 -r -len 2048
</span><span class='line'>pvk2pfx -pvk mykey.pvk -spc ADTestVaultApplication.cer -pfx ADTestVaultApplication.pfx -po test
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>This certificate is then used to create the AD application using the below script.</p>

<p>To associate the application created with the Key Vault, we need to create a service principal using <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dn986799.aspx">New-AzureADServicePrincipal</a> and then associate that with the Vault using the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/azure/dn903607.aspx">Set-AzureKeyVaultAccessPolicy</a></p>

<h4><strong>Adding a Certificate</strong></h4>

<p>The <em><a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/azure/dn194106.aspx">New-MsolServicePrincipalCredential</a></em> cmdlet is used to add a new credential to a service principal or to an application. The service principal is identified by supplying one of the following: object ID, appPrincipalID, service principal name (SPN).</p>

<h4><strong>Removing a Certificate</strong></h4>

<p>Whenever a credential gets compromised or as part of regular credential refresh, administrators would want to remove an old certificate and replace with a new one. The <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/azure/dn194125.aspx">Remove-MsolServicePrincipalCredential</a> cmdlet is used to remove a credential key from a service principal by specifying the key ID for the credential and the objectID/applicationID/ServicePrincipalName to identify the service principal. To get the key ID of an existing credential, <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/azure/dn194091.aspx">Get-MsolServicePrincipalCredential</a> cmdlet can be used, which returns the list of credentials associated with a service principal. The below script just removes the first credential, you could loop through and remove all.</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>

<h4><strong>Delete an application</strong></h4>

<p>The <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/azure/dn194113.aspx">Remove-MsolServicePrincipal</a> cmdlet removes a service principal from Microsoft Azure Active Directory, by specifying objectID/applicationID/ServicePrincipalName to identify the service principal.</p>

<p>Managing the AD application is a very important and necessary process in the life cycle of a Key Vault, as the access to the Vault is controlled using that. Certificates securing the AD applciation should be rolled/updated frequently and application permissions should be reviewed often to make sure that all applications have only the required permissions.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In todays world the problem&rsquo;s that are solved by technology are innumerous and it is not just a single system that the customer is looking for. They usually need multiple systems solving different problems around their core domain. But as developers, we usually get carried away by the technology aspect of it, giving lesser importance to the problem or domain itself. Whenever we have multiple systems targeting the same core domain of the customer, we see that what gets reused across these systems are the &lsquo;<a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-in/library/ee658105.aspx">Crosscutting concerns</a>&rsquo; like Caching, Authentication, Logging, Exception Management etc. But is this what really should be getting shared? Are our customer trying to solve these crosscutting issues? Should it not be their core domain logics and rules and validations that get shared. The Architecture Screams Technology preventing anything else but these crosscutting concerns (which are not technology specific) the only thing that is shareable across systems.</p>

<h3>Common Traits of Technology Coupling</h3>

<p>There are a lot of traits that indicate this dependency on technology and makes a system modeled around technology stand out from the one modeled around the domain. Below are some of the things that I have figured out are very strong hints indicating a tight coupling with the technology. The earlier we identify such smells the better we are to retract and get ourselves align to the needs of the domain and not the technology.</p>

<p><strong>Solution Folders and Projects</strong></p>

<p>Take a look at your solution directory from the top level and what do you infer that it is all about. Does it have folders reflecting technology stacks like ASP.Net, Web API, WPF, Ruby, NHibernate etc or does it reflect the domain space that you are trying to solve like Shipping, Stock Management, Customer Relations? This should give the first hint on what the Architecture of your application reflects. But you could easily get tricked here as &lsquo;what you see might not be what it is&rsquo;, so lets take a step in.
Before we do you might ask, Are we not building a web-site for the customer so what is wrong in having the structure indicate that? We are building a solution that solves certain problems for our customer, it is only that it is getting delivered or accessed via a web-site. Tomorrow this might be delivered via a mobile application or a rich desktop client or even a console application so having it tightly bound to web delivery mechanism is only going to hinder us on the way forward.</p>

<p><strong>Single Large Interface Project</strong></p>

<p>Having all the interfaces used across the application to be in a single interfaces project is something that I have come across quite often and this clearly indicates that something is definitely wrong here. As mentioned in <a href="http://www.amazon.in/gp/product/0131857258/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=3626&amp;creative=24822&amp;creativeASIN=0131857258&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=rahulpnath-21&amp;linkId=VVMXRINDZWYFRWP4">Agile Principles, Patterns, and Practices in C#</a> by <a href="https://twitter.com/unclebobmartin">Uncle Bob</a>, Interfaces should belong to the clients and should stay close to them. If multiple clients needs to use the same interface then probably you could move them out into a common library. But all interfaces in a single project possibly means you have more of <a href="http://martinfowler.com/bliki/HeaderInterface.html">Header Interfaces</a> and not <a href="http://blog.ploeh.dk/2013/01/10/RoleInterfaceRoleHint/">Role interfaces</a> as that would primarily be specific to the clients that use them. Also watch out for the references that these projects have and whether they have any technology specific references which would possibly indicate a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leaky_abstraction">leaky abstraction</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Single Large Entities Project</strong></p>

<p>Same as interfaces, this is another common thing that is quite common and might possible indicate a problem in the way a domain is modeled. In a complex domain it is highly likely that an entity is not the same everywhere and is very context specific. A customer might have a different meaning in the context of Shipping and totally different in context of Customer Relations, but having a single customer that is acts as a super set for all these contexts is a problem. Also having all the entities together probably means that enough thought has not been put into separating what parts of the system changes together and what does not. This is a clear indication of poorly modeled domain. On top of this if you are using any kind of O/RM technologies to map these to the database then it just adds on to your problems when you use a single large context to map to the database.</p>

<p><strong>No Explicit boundaries</strong></p>

<p>It&rsquo;s very likely that the application talks across difference boundaries and interacts with different systems. Some of them might be external, like a third party service and some other are internal, most commonly a database. If you see the same entities that are passed along at all these boundaries then its very likely that you have a leaky abstraction, which again would get reflected by looking at the reference folder of Entities/Interfaces project. This kind of abstractions tend to break the entire system when any of these boundaries changes, causing a  rippling effect in the code.</p>

<p><strong>Source Control Commit History</strong></p>

<p>Looking at the previous commits in your source control you can tell if your dependencies are well managed and if there are a lot of technology coupling. If you have commits that have large number of files associated especially one&rsquo;s modified then it again means that you have a lot of leaking abstractions. This leak could be a technology leak or even a function leak, where the abstractions are not well contained which causes a ripple effect when anything associated changes.</p>

<p><strong>Anemic Domain Model</strong></p>

<p>This is one of the most common and greatest indication of technology coupling and lack of proper modeling of the problem domain. Open up any of the classes in your entities project and all you see are properties with getters and setters with hardly any function in them. Object Oriented Programming brought data and functions together, but hardly do we see them together. We either have classes that act as data bags or classes that use these data classes to perform transactions over them. <a href="http://www.martinfowler.com/bliki/AnemicDomainModel.html">Anemic Domain Model </a> works fine for applications that perform basic <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Create,_read,_update_and_delete">CRUD</a> operations and with very less business logic in them, but as complexity grows it becomes very difficult to maintain and extend. Anemia in the entities is the biggest reason why we end up having only cross-cutting features to be shared across applications for the same domain.</p>

<h3>Onion Architecture</h3>

<p>Technology should be only seen as enablers for solving the problems and it should never get in way of the original problem. Onion Architecture or Hexagonal Architecture try to solve this problem of keeping the domain model clean and separate and have the technology dependency point into it. This enables switching out the technology specific implementations at any point and also enabling us to reuse the core domain components across various systems or hosts.</p>

<blockquote><p>&ldquo;The overriding rule that makes this architecture work is <em>The Dependency Rule</em>. This rule says that source code dependencies can only point inwards. Nothing in an inner circle can know anything at all about something in an outer circle. In particular, the name of something declared in an outer circle must not be mentioned by the code in the an inner circle. That includes, functions, classes. variables, or any other named software entity.&rdquo;</p></blockquote>

<p>Screaming technology is a common thing in many a projects and it is not really a big problem when the domain you are trying to solve is not that complex. But usually that is not the case and we have very complex domain logics, multiple systems targeting for different areas and highly volatile requirements. These are just some of the most common indications that I have come across that indicate a tightly coupled solution. The <a href="http://www.objectmentor.com/resources/articles/CoffeeMaker.pdf">Mark IV Special Coffee Maker</a> problem presented by Uncle Bob in his <a href="Agile%20Principles,%20Patterns,%20and%20Practices%20in%20C#](http://www.amazon.in/gp/product/0131857258/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=3626&amp;creative=24822&amp;creativeASIN=0131857258&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=rahulpnath-21&amp;linkId=VVMXRINDZWYFRWP4">book</a>, presents us with an interesting modeling problem, shows some most common errors, why they are errors and possible ways to tackle them. That just helps to get started to think on the right path, to tackle issues in larger domains, methodologies like <a href="http://www.amazon.in/gp/product/0321125215/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=3626&amp;creative=24822&amp;creativeASIN=0321125215&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=rahulpnath-21&amp;linkId=F6WJ7JK5CYQOIJV6">Domain Driven Design</a> would help us to solve the actual domain problems.</p>

    <link href="http://rahulpnath.com/blog/azure-key-vault-in-a-real-world-application/"/>
    <updated>2015-04-25T16:16:09+10:00</updated>
    <id>http://rahulpnath.com/blog/azure-key-vault-in-a-real-world-application</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<blockquote><p>Please check <a href="http://www.rahulpnath.com/blog/how-the-deprecation-of-switch-azuremode-affects-azure-key-vault/">here</a> for scripts using the latest PowerShell cmdlets.</p></blockquote>

<p>Over the last couple of posts we have seen how to <a href="http://www.rahulpnath.com/blog/getting-started-with-azure-key-vault/">Get Started with Azure Key Vault</a>, <a href="http://www.rahulpnath.com/blog/authenticating-a-client-application-with-azure-key-vault/">Authenticate a Client Application with the Vault</a> and also on how the vault can be used as an <a href="http://www.rahulpnath.com/blog/moving-sensitive-information-from-configuration-file-to-azure-key-vault/">alternate to the configuration file to keep sensitive information secure</a>. In this post we will explore into how a key vault can be fit into the life-cycle of an application, configuring application to use the keyvault for different deployments and also on how to manage the keys/secrets for these different deployments. Any application that uses the Key Vault to manage keys and other sensitive information, should be able to switch easily to use the vault configured for it.</p>

<h3>Configuring Client-Applications to use the Key vault</h3>

<p>Objects are uniquely identified within Azure Key Vault using a URL such that no two objects in the system, regardless of geo-location, have the same URL. The complete URL to an object is called the Object Identifier and consists of a prefix portion that identifies the Key Vault, the object type, a user provided Object Name, and an Object Version. The <em>object-name</em> is case-insensitive and immutable. When an object is first created it is given a unique version identifier and is marked as the current version of the object. Creation of a new instance with the same object name gives the new object a unique version identifier and causes it to become the current version. When querying for an object <em>object-version</em> is optional and if not provided will point to the current version of the given object-name.</p>

<blockquote>https://{keyvault-name}.vault.azure.net/{object-type}/{object-name}/{object-version}</blockquote>


<p>From a client application all we need to have is to the configuration for the key vault url, and configurations to identify key/secret name which can include the version if required. This could be saved in the application&rsquo;s configuration file as shown below.</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='xml'><span class='line'><span class="nt">&lt;appSettings&gt;</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="nt">&lt;add</span> <span class="na">key=</span><span class="s">&quot;KeyVaultUrl&quot;</span> <span class="na">value=</span><span class="s">&quot;https://testvaultrahul.vault.azure.net&quot;</span><span class="nt">/&gt;</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="nt">&lt;add</span> <span class="na">key=</span><span class="s">&quot;SqlConnectionString&quot;</span> <span class="na">value=</span><span class="s">&quot;SqlConnectionString&quot;</span><span class="nt">/&gt;</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="nt">&lt;add</span> <span class="na">key =</span><span class="s">&quot;SecretWithVersion&quot;</span> <span class="na">value=</span><span class="s">&quot;SecretWithVersion/cfedea84815e4ca8bc19cf8eb943ee13&quot;</span><span class="nt">/&gt;</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="nt">&lt;add</span> <span class="na">key=</span><span class="s">&quot;CryptoKey&quot;</span> <span class="na">value=</span><span class="s">&quot;CryptoKey&quot;</span><span class="nt">/&gt;</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="nt">&lt;/appSettings&gt;</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>In the above configuration I assume that when these configurations are used from the code, we know that if a value is a key or secret. We could have an extended configuration or string prefix&rsquo;s (key<em> or secret</em>) to indicate this and then have the code automatically detect it too if required to decouple that, but I don&rsquo;t see it really necessary. So the application at any time would only depend on these configured values, and we can easily switch it use any vault configured with the required key/secret values.</p>

<h3>Managing the Key Vault for Multiple Deployments</h3>

<p>Now that we have decoupled the application from the Key Vault, we need to see how to configure key vaults to cater for multiple deployments. In any application development life-cycle, there would be multiple deployments at a given time for the application to cater for different roles - developers, testers and maybe a production one too. It is very likely that the connection strings and other sensitive information would be deployment specific and we would want to keep them separate. Best way to achieve this would be to create Key vault per deployment so that this separation is clearly maintained. You could check on the <a href="http://azure.microsoft.com/en-in/pricing/details/key-vault/">Key Vault Pricing</a> on how this would affect your overall cost. For each of these deployments you would need to make sure that all the required keys/secrets are added with valid values. Since this can soon end up as a repeated activity, it is best to automate this (using powershell scripts or your own application)</p>

<h3>Restricting Permissions to Key Vault</h3>

<p>We had seen how to <a href="http://www.rahulpnath.com/blog/authenticating-a-client-application-with-azure-key-vault/">authenticate a client application with a Key Vault</a> using an Active Directory (AD) application, and how to set various access policies for these application&rsquo;s. Applications should be given only the minimum set of permissions that it requires to operate on, most probably this would be only the read permissions. For <a href="https://github.com/rahulpnath/AzureKeyVaultExplorer">administrative application&rsquo;s</a> we would want to give all permissions so that it can modify the vault keys/secrets as required. For such a scenario it is best to have, two (or more) separate AD application&rsquo;s created and have separate permissions provided.</p>

<p><img class="center" alt="Multiple AD applications to access key vault with different permissions" src="http://rahulpnath.com/images/multiple_ad_application.PNG" /></p>

<h3>What all should be there in my configuration file?</h3>

<p>All your <a href="http://www.rahulpnath.com/blog/moving-sensitive-information-from-configuration-file-to-azure-key-vault/">sensitive information should be moved out of your application configuration file</a>, and Key Vault is the one place to have them all. The application&rsquo;s configuration file should only have the azure key vault url and the AD application id and certificate identifier (thumb print) that can be used to authenticate with the AD. Yes it is advisable to use the <a href="http://www.rahulpnath.com/blog/authenticating-a-client-application-with-azure-key-vault/">certificate authentication mechanism</a> as opposed to the secret mechanism, if not you would have to put the secret in your configuration file, which would be like &lsquo;giving a thief the key to your safe&rsquo;.Additionally you could also have the key identifier mappings in the configuration file that the application can use to map to key/secret in the vault as we had seen above.</p>

<p>By doing this we have fully decoupled the application and its dependency with the vault store and have also protected all our sensitive information. This also helps in having the application to be tested with configurations appropriate to the type of deployment. Hope this helps you in developing your application against the key vault.</p>

    <title type="html"><![CDATA[Is Code Coverage a Lie?]]></title>
    <link href="http://rahulpnath.com/blog/is-code-coverage-a-lie/"/>
    <updated>2015-04-11T23:30:42+10:00</updated>
    <id>http://rahulpnath.com/blog/is-code-coverage-a-lie</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Code Coverage has been one of the important things that was always there on a daily build report and a number that managers were both interested and worried about. This has been the same for all projects that I had worked on, across various organizations. Various tools support measuring coverage and can be included as part of the build reports, which essentially indicates the percentage of source code that is covered by &lsquo;unit tests&rsquo;. A higher percentage obviously indicates a better tested code and more stable one is what one would expect, as that would be the sole purpose of measuring this. But how far is this true? Is a code with higher test percentage one with lesser bugs? Does 100% indicate that it is totally bug free or is this a total wrong way of seeing that number?</p>

<h3>What is Code Coverage and How is it Measured?</h3>

<p>Code Coverage indicates the percentage of code that has been covered by at least one or more tests in your test suite. So if you have a simple function like the one shown below, which just divides two numbers and if you have one test that invokes that function, then you have a code coverage of 100%. When using Visual studio tests (as that is what I have used to depict the below one), code coverage is measured either based on blocks of code or based on lines of code.</p>

<ul>
<li><h4>Block-based statement coverage</h4>

<p>For the purposes of the tools, a block is defined as a sequence of instructions that have a single entry point and a single exit point. Exit points include branch instructions, a function call, a return instruction, or, for managed code, a throw instruction.</p></li>
<li><h4>Line-based coverage</h4>

<p>For line-based coverage, the tools identify all of the blocks that make up a line and then use this information to determine the level of coverage for the line. If all of the blocks that make up the line are covered, then the tools report that the line is covered. If no blocks in the line are covered, then the tools report that the line is not covered. If some, but not all, of the blocks in the line are covered, then the tools report that the line is partially covered.</p></li>
</ul>


<p>In the below case we have both 100% as there is only one line and one block and the test covers both. So should managers be happy with this code, since it has 100% coverage? Maybe they are, but ask the developers, they definitely are not, or probably they are if at the first place they wrote the tests for the sake of the report and since the managers are happy they too are. But is this what we should strive for - definitely not!</p>

<p><img class="center" alt="Visual Studio Code Coverage" src="http://rahulpnath.com/images/code_coverage.PNG" /></p>

<h3>Trustworthy Unit Tests</h3>

<blockquote><p>Unit tests should be like a parachute - trustworthy. You are not going to jump out from an airplane with one that you know is faulty.</p></blockquote>

<p>Having unit tests that are run once in a while or just for the build reports or when the manager is at your back, are a complete waste of time. A set of faulty tests do more harm than having none, as it might give wrong judgment of the code. From the above code you can definitely find that though the coverage is 100%, the code would simply fail when a value of 0 is passed for &lsquo;b&rsquo;, and it is highly likely that this would happen too.</p>

<blockquote><p>If unit tests are written just to meet the code coverage number on a report, then I would rather fake the report than writing the tests</p></blockquote>

<p>Unit Tests really make sense only when you write them following &lsquo;<a href="http://butunclebob.com/ArticleS.UncleBob.TheThreeRulesOfTdd">The Three Rules of TDD</a>&rsquo; or at the very least you have tests associated with every change that you make and also you make sure that we run the entire test suite before a check-in to make sure that you have broken nothing with your changes. Only when there is such &lsquo;trustworthiness&rsquo; in the tests, does it make sense to have them in the first place and not for any number on a report.</p>

<h3>How should we really see that number on the report?</h3>

<p>Now that we have seen it is all about having trustworthy tests and not about reaching a targeted number for a report, what should we really use this Code coverage report data for?</p>

<ol>
<li>If you are less than 100% it clearly indicates that there are areas of your application that is not tested. You would really want to cross check if that is an intended miss or if there is something that is actually missing and add in some more tests to be covered better.</li>
<li>When refactoring code, you can always make sure that you don&rsquo;t go back on the coverage number that you started with, so as to ensure that you have not introduced untested code into the system.</li>
<li>When cleaning up tests a drop in the coverage number clearly indicates that you have actually removed some valid and non-redundant tests.</li>
</ol>


<p>So the next time you add in a test, think why you are doing it. Is it for the report or for the application that is getting developed. Lets all <a href="https://vimeo.com/43536488">strive to be really professional</a> in what we are doing and not just hide behind some numbers. Let the number be seen for what it is - nothing less and nothing more!</p>

    <id>http://rahulpnath.com/blog/moving-sensitive-information-from-configuration-file-to-azure-key-vault</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<blockquote><p>Please check <a href="http://www.rahulpnath.com/blog/how-the-deprecation-of-switch-azuremode-affects-azure-key-vault/">here</a> for scripts using the latest PowerShell cmdlets.</p></blockquote>

<p>Most of the applications today needs to use some kind of sensitive information like a database connection-string, api secret or passwords for it to connect to external service providers. Today we see that all these information are stored in the application&rsquo;s configuration file, which poses a huge security risk. Anyone having access to this configuration file could use this information to access sensitive data posing a security risk. Having understood this risk, we would not want to keep these secrets anymore in the application but move it to a safer and secure place. With <a href="http://www.rahulpnath.com/blog/getting-started-with-azure-key-vault/">Azure Key Vault</a>, we can have this information encrypted and saved safely out of the application and use as required from the application.Azure Key Vault provides a feature of saving such small data, <strong>Secrets</strong>, into the vault and access them over a secure endpoint.</p>

<blockquote><p>Secrets in Azure Key Vault are octet sequences with a maximum size of 10k bytes each and can have any data stored.</p></blockquote>

<p>If you are new to Azure Key Vault and yet to setup a vault, you could refer to <a href="http://www.rahulpnath.com/blog/getting-started-with-azure-key-vault/">Getting Started with Azure Key Vault</a>, to setup the vault and the Active Directory(AD) application that is used to authenticate our application to access the keyvault. Since in this case we are going to use Secrets from the key vault, while setting the key vault access policy for the the AD application, we need to explicitly set access for the application to use the secrets. Access Policy to secrets and keys are distinct and can be set accordingly and you can choose to have different application&rsquo;s to access keys and secrets separately. In the below script I have set the same application to have access to keys and secrets, by setting  <em>PermissionsToKeys</em> and <em>PermissionsToSecrets</em></p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='powershell'><span class='line'><span class="nb">Set-AzureKeyVaultAccessPolicy</span> <span class="n">-VaultName</span> <span class="s1">&#39;TestVaultRahul&#39;</span> <span class="n">-ServicePrincipalName</span> <span class="s1">&#39;d4f09821-ab30-44f3-8d57-69925489b932&#39;</span> <span class="n">-PermissionsToKeys</span> <span class="n">all</span> <span class="n">-PermissionsToSecrets</span> <span class="n">all</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>To create a secret in the Vault, you can use the powershell script command as shown below. On successful creation of the secret the identifier to the secret is returned, which can be used by the application to obtain the Secret value.Since we have given the AD application &lsquo;<em>all</em>&rsquo; access, we could also create the secret using the api client.</p>

<p>For the application to access this secret all it needs is the SecretIdentifier and the AD credentials to authenticate with the key vault. You would want to use <a href="http://www.rahulpnath.com/blog/authenticating-a-client-application-with-azure-key-vault/">certificate based authentication</a> to authenticate against the AD application so that only the thumbprint information needs to be there in the application&rsquo;s configuration and not the secret itself as that is again a sensitive information.</p>

<p>No longer do we need to keep these sensitive information in the applications configuration file, we can just have the Secret Identifiers configured in the application and have the application fetch is as required from the vault. By doing this we have kept the sensitive information out of reach from the application and also from the people who have access to a production environment.</p>

<p>Azure Key Vault provides an easy way for managing cryptographic keys and secrets (like connection strings or passwords) in a secure and distributed manner as opposed to having them in the configuration file or a database. If you are new to Azure Key Vault check out the <a href="http://www.rahulpnath.com/blog/getting-started-with-azure-key-vault/">Getting Started with Azure Key Vault</a> on how to setup the vault and add keys and use that from a console application.</p>

<p>In this post we will explore into the ways of authenticating a client application with a key vault. For an application to use the key vault it must authenticate using a token from the Azure Active Directory (AD). For this an application needs to be registered in the Azure AD and this application needs to be authorized to access key or secret in the vault using the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/azure/dn903607.aspx">Set-AzureKeyVaultAccessPolicy</a> that comes as part of the <a href="https://gallery.technet.microsoft.com/scriptcenter/Azure-Key-Vault-Powershell-1349b091">key vault powershell scripts</a>.</p>

<blockquote><p>As of today, the keyvault will be created in the Default AD associated to the azure subscription and there is no way that it can be created in a different directory. But maybe this will be <a href="https://social.msdn.microsoft.com/Forums/azure/en-US/21d0dcaa-791c-4f96-8f9d-738b6b0076b2/create-a-new-key-vault-in-a-different-directory?forum=AzureKeyVault">supported in future</a>.</p></blockquote>

<p>So for a client to access the key vault, it needs to obtain the token from the Azure AD application, which can be done using 2 ways:</p>

<ul>
<li>Using ClientId and secret</li>
<li>Using ClientId and certificate</li>
</ul>


<h4><strong>Using ClientId and Secret</strong></h4>

<p>Creating an application that can be authenticated using clientid and secret can be done using the management portal. In the azure management portal, we need to create to the application under the default AD. To find the default AD you can check under the settings in the portal</p>

<p><img class="center" alt="Default Active Directory under Settings" src="http://rahulpnath.com/images/default_ad_settings.PNG" /></p>

<p>To add an application in the default, under Active Directory select the default AD and the applications tab and select &lsquo;<em>Add an application</em>&rsquo;.</p>

<p><img class="center" alt="Create an Application under default" src="http://rahulpnath.com/images/default_ad.PNG" /></p>

<p>From the pop-up select &lsquo;<em>Add an application my organization is developing</em>&rsquo; and give a name of your choice and of type &lsquo;<em>Web Application AND/OR WEB API</em>&rsquo;. In the App properties window it asks for the &lsquo;<em>Sign-On Url</em>&rsquo; and &lsquo;<em>App ID Uri</em>&rsquo;, for which you can give two unique values and is not mandatory that it should exists. On confirming these values the AD application would be created and you would be presented with the application properties. Under the &lsquo;<em>Configure</em>&rsquo; tab, you can see the Client ID and below that there is an option to create the &lsquo;<em>keys</em>&rsquo; which will be the secret.</p>

<p><img class="center" alt="AD Application Configure" src="http://rahulpnath.com/images/ad_application_configure.PNG" /></p>

<p>In the drop-down under the keys select the duration and choose a duration of your choice and save. On saving the secret will be generated. Copy this secret and keep for reference to use in the client application.</p>

<p><img class="center" alt="AD Application Secret Generation" src="http://rahulpnath.com/images/ad_application_keys.PNG" /></p>

<p>Now that we have created the application and have the clientid and the secret we need to authorize the application to access the key vault. For this we use the <em>Set-AzureKeyVaultAccessPolicy</em> from the powershell and provide the client id of the application that we have just created. The <em>PermissionToKeys</em> parameter determines the permission that the application would have on the keys in the vault which can take multiple comma separated values (all, backup, create, decrypt, delete, encrypt, import, get, list, restore, sign, wrapkey, unwrapkey, update and verify). Similarly for access to secrets in the keyvault you need to set <em>PermissionToSecrets</em> which can all take multiple values (all, delete, get, list and set).</p>

</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Now using the clientid and the secret we can authenticate from the client application using it as below</p>

</span><span class='line'><span class="p">});</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<h4><strong>Using ClientId and Certificate</strong></h4>

<p>Creating an application that can be authenticated using the clientid and the certificate is only possible using powershell scripts, and these are again available with the key vault powershell scripts. For this we first need to create a certificate or if your organization already has provided one use that. Since this is for demo I would be creating a test certificate as <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-in/library/ff699202.aspx">explained here</a>.</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>

</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Once we have the certificate, we can create a new AD application and specify certificate authentication for the application as shown below. Make sure that you give the full path to the certificate as below (mine was located under C:\cert)</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>

</span><span class='line'><span class="nv">$newADApplication</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">appId</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Once the application is created, we need to perform the same authorization steps as above to give the application access to the key vault, after which we can use the clientid (that would be output to the powershell console) and the certificate to authenticate the application. Make sure that the certificate is installed into the store so that it can be used by the application.</p>

<p>You could use either ways to authenticate an application to Azure Key Vault. Using the certificate way would be more secure as you can also password protect your certificate so that it cannot be installed without having that. If using the client secret anybody having access to the configuration would be able to access the vault. Also make sure that you give the application&rsquo;s only necessary permissions for accessing keys and secrets while registering the application. You could use the sample used in the <a href="http://www.rahulpnath.com/blog/getting-started-with-azure-key-vault/">Getting Started with Azure Key Vault</a> <a href="https://github.com/rahulpnath/Blog/tree/master/AzureKeyVault">sample</a>. The code in there uses clientId and secret, you could change it with the above code to use certificate authentication.</p>

<p>Azure Key Vault service is a cloud hosted, HSM(Hardware Security Modules)-backed service for managing cryptographic keys and other secrets. With Azure Key Vault, the process of managing and controlling the keys required for an application or multiple applications for an enterprise can be handled at a centralized place. Also these sensitive information no longer needs to be exposed in the application&rsquo;s configuration file or in database. Keys can be created in the vault and accessed via url&rsquo;s by the required application. Operations against the Key Vault are authenticated and authorized using Azure Active Directory. So in short all that a developer would need to know are the URI&rsquo;s for the keys, the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/azure/dn903625.aspx">sdk/api</a> to access the vault features and also on the mechanism to authenticate against the AD application (an appId/client secret or appId/certificate).</p>

<p><img class="center" alt="Azure Key Vault Overview" src="http://rahulpnath.com/images/azurekeyvault_overview.png" /></p>

<h3>Key Types</h3>

<p>The initial release of Azure Key Vault only supports RSA keys (asymmetric cryptography) - it supports both software and HSM processed keys, and are represented as JSON Web Key objects. In future there might be more support for the different key types that are there in cryptography. For those who are new to cryptography or needs a quick recap on cryptography algorithms:</p>

<h5><strong>Symmetric Cryptography</strong></h5>

<p>Symmetric cryptography, uses the same key to encrypt and decrypt the data. The keys are shared between the identities that require to transfer the encrypted data.</p>

<p><img class="center" alt="Symmetric Encryption" src="http://rahulpnath.com/images/symmetric_encryption.png" /></p>

<h5><strong>Asymmetric Cryptography</strong></h5>

<p>Asymmetric cryptography, also known as public key cryptography uses two separate keys - a public key and private key. The public key can be used to encrypt the data or to verify a digital signature whereas the private key is used to decrypt the text or to digital sign.</p>

<p><img class="center" alt="Asymmetric Encryption" src="http://rahulpnath.com/images/asymmetric_encryption.png" /></p>

<p>To create a new key in the Azure Key Vault, first we need to create the vault, using powershell scripts. You would need to install <a href="http://www.rahulpnath.com/blog/azure-key-vault-and-powershell-module-version/">azure module version 0.8.13 version or higher</a> for the key vault scripts to execute. Detailed steps on creating the vault and keys is documented <a href="http://azure.microsoft.com/en-in/documentation/articles/key-vault-get-started/">here</a>. Once we have the key created we can get the attributes of the key, using <em>Get-AzureKeyVaultKey</em>. This is as per the <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-jose-json-web-key-41#page-25">JSON Web Key(JWK) format</a>. The &lsquo;<em>n/e</em>&rsquo; values in the below key are for the RSA key type(<em>kty</em>), showing the public key information.</p>

<h3>Key Operations</h3>

<p>Now that we have a key in the vault, we can use this to perform different operations allowed on the key, as provided in the <em>key_ops</em> field in the key details above. Typical operations that can be performed using the key are Encrypt, Decrypt, Sign, Verify, WrapKey and UnWrapKey. For an application to use the key vault keys, it needs to authenticate using a token from the Azure Active Directory. For this we first need to <a href="http://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/articles/key-vault-get-started/#register">register an application with azure active directory</a> and then use the Application id and Authentication key(client secret) to authenticate against the AD application. Instead of using the  key/secret, this could also be through a certificate authentication, which might be a more preferred approach(For the simplicity of this demo will use the application id and the secret directly). To connect to the AD application we can use the <a href="https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.IdentityModel.Clients.ActiveDirectory/2.14.201151115">Active Directory Authentication Library</a> nuget package, the KeyVault libraries are availalble as part of the <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=45343">samples</a>.</p>

<p>The application first uses the AD application credentials to authenticate and obtain the token for further interacting with the key vault. Using the key identifier that is available we get the details of the key.For performing the get operation the &lsquo;<em>PermissionToKeys</em>&rsquo;, should be set appropriately when registering the AD application, using Set-AzureKeyVaultAccessPolicy, against the key vault. Since this is RSA asymmetric algorithm, we have the public key available to us, and we can use this to encrypt the data or to verify the signature, locally in the application itself, though the vault client provides this for convenience.</p>

<p>As above, we use the public key available to create the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/System.Security.Cryptography.RSACryptoServiceProvider(v=vs.110).aspx">RSACryptoServiceProvider</a> to encrypt the data and also to verify the signature locally. So in an application we can encrypt the data locally and use the vault to decrypt it when required. Decryption can happen only from the vault, as the private key is only available in the vault, and does not cross the vault boundary.</p>

<p>With Azure Key Vault, managing keys and restricting application permission for keys can be easily managed and no information needs to be passed on to the developer or to any specific individual. Also the keys are secure behind the vault service and can also be protected using a HSM. You would need to update the application id and secret in the <a href="https://github.com/rahulpnath/Blog/tree/master/AzureKeyVault">sample</a> for it to work. Hope this helps in getting you started with Azure Key Vault.</p>

<blockquote><p>When you use the Azure PowerShell cmdlets, the Azure module is imported into the session by default. To remove the Azure module from the session and import the AzureResourceManager and AzureProfile modules, use the Switch-AzureMode cmdlet.</p></blockquote>

<p><em>You would face this issue only if you started trying out the steps as mentioned in the <a href="http://blogs.technet.com/b/kv/archive/2015/01/09/azure-key-vault-step-by-step.aspx">azure key vault blog</a>(as I did), since the steps in the <a href="http://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/articles/key-vault-get-started/">documentation site</a></em> is updated with the above step.*</p>
